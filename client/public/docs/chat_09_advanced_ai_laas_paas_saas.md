**Email Deliverability:**
- 98.5-99.1% across all providers

**Enterprise Systems:**
- ERP Users: 15,000 total users with 2,500 concurrent
- System Performance: 99.97% uptime with 125ms response time
- Data Processing: 2.5M API calls daily with 0.02% error rate
- Customer Satisfaction: 4.6/5.0 rating with 4.2-hour resolution time

**Cloud Services:**
- Scale: 500,000 SaaS users, 25,000 VMs, 75,000 containers
- Performance: 45ms global latency, 10Tbps peak throughput
- Reliability: 99.99% availability with auto-scaling
- Financial: $125M monthly revenue with 35% profit margin

## Task Outcome

### Context Limit Reached
The task stopped due to context length limitations while implementing advanced communication features (Voice, Text, Email, Satellite, G-Services). The system indicated:

> "The current task context has reached its limit and cannot continue."
