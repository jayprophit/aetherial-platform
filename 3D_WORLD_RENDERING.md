# AETHERIAL Platform 3D World Rendering Engine

## 1. Objective

To create a high-performance and visually stunning 3D world rendering engine that can run smoothly in a web browser. This engine will be the foundation of the AETHERIAL metaverse, allowing users to explore, interact with, and create their own 3D content.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Rendering Engine

- **Concept:** We will use the powerful `three.js` library as the core of our rendering engine. `three.js` is the most popular and well-supported WebGL library, providing a high-level API for creating and displaying 3D graphics.
- **Implementation:** We will create a modular and extensible rendering engine on top of `three.js`, allowing for easy integration of new features and content.

### b. Asset Loading

- **Concept:** We will need to efficiently load a variety of 3D assets, including models, textures, and animations.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `GLTFLoader` for loading 3D models in the glTF format, which is the industry standard for 3D assets on the web. We will also implement a system for streaming assets to reduce initial loading times.

### c. Interaction

- **Concept:** Users will be able to interact with the 3D world using their mouse and keyboard.
- **Implementation:** We will implement a first-person or third-person camera controller, as well as a system for picking and interacting with objects in the scene.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **three.js Integration:** Integrate `three.js` into our client-side application.
2.  **Basic Scene:** Create a basic scene with a camera, lighting, and a ground plane.
3.  **Asset Loading:** Implement a system for loading and displaying 3D models.
4.  **Interaction:** Implement a camera controller and object picking.
5.  **Optimization:** Optimize the rendering engine for performance and scalability.
