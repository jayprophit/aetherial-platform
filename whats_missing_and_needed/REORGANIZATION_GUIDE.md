## How to Run the Reorganization

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml
   ```
3. Run the reorganization script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/reorganize_platform.py
   ```

## Post-Reorganization Steps

1. Review the changes:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Test the platform:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Verification

After running the reorganization script, verify the following:

1. All files have been moved to their correct locations
2. All tests are passing
3. The application starts without errors
4. All API endpoints are functioning as expected

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the script output for any error messages
2. Verify file permissions
3. Ensure all required environment variables are set
4. Check the logs for any service-specific errors
