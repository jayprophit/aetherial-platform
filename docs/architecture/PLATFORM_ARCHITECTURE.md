# Aetherial Platform Architecture

## Overview
A comprehensive platform integrating gift cards, vouchers, charitable donations, and think tank funding through blockchain technology.

## Core Components

### 1. Blockchain Layer
- Smart contracts for gift cards, vouchers, and donations
- Token contracts for platform utility and governance
- DAO governance for think tank funding decisions

### 2. Backend Services
- RESTful API for frontend communication
- Authentication and authorization services
- Payment processing integration
- Database models and migrations

### 3. Frontend Applications
- User dashboard
- Gift card marketplace
- Donation portal
- Think tank proposal system

### 4. Security
- KYC/AML integration
- Smart contract audits
- Secure key management
- Regular security assessments

## Technical Stack

### Blockchain
- **Network**: Ethereum, Polygon (for scaling)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat/Truffle
- **Wallets**: MetaMask, WalletConnect

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express/NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with Next.js
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Library**: Material-UI/Chakra UI
- **Web3**: Web3.js/ethers.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Hardhat/Truffle
- PostgreSQL

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Start local blockchain: `npx hardhat node`
5. Deploy contracts: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
6. Start backend: `npm run dev:backend`
7. Start frontend: `npm run dev:frontend`

## Security Considerations
- All smart contracts should be audited before deployment
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use secure, non-custodial wallet solutions
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
