# AETHERIAL Platform - Load and Stress Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance on load testing and stress testing for the AETHERIAL platform. Load testing validates that the system can handle expected traffic levels, while stress testing identifies breaking points and system limits.

---

## Testing Types

### Load Testing

Load testing simulates realistic user traffic patterns to verify that the system performs acceptably under expected load conditions. The platform includes several load testing scenarios designed to mimic real-world usage patterns.

**Sustained Load Testing** simulates a constant number of concurrent users over an extended period. This test validates that the system can maintain performance under steady-state conditions without degradation over time. The test runs with a configured number of concurrent users (default: 50) for a specified duration (default: 60 seconds), with each user making requests at realistic intervals.

**Ramp-Up Testing** gradually increases the number of concurrent users from zero to a target maximum over a specified time period. This simulates the natural growth pattern of user traffic and helps identify at what point performance begins to degrade. The test starts with zero users and incrementally adds users until reaching the maximum (default: 100 users), then maintains that load for the test duration.

**User Journey Testing** simulates realistic user behavior by executing complete user workflows rather than isolated requests. Each simulated user follows a predefined journey through the application, visiting multiple pages and interacting with various features. This provides a more accurate representation of real-world load than simple endpoint testing.

**Spike Testing** validates system behavior when traffic suddenly increases dramatically. This test starts with normal load, rapidly increases to a much higher level (simulating a traffic spike), maintains the spike for a period, then returns to normal load. This helps identify how the system handles sudden traffic surges and whether it recovers gracefully.

### Stress Testing

Stress testing pushes the system beyond normal operating conditions to identify breaking points and maximum capacity. Unlike load testing, which validates expected performance, stress testing deliberately overloads the system to find its limits.

**Breaking Point Testing** gradually increases load until the system fails or performance becomes unacceptable. This test starts with a low number of concurrent users and incrementally increases the load, monitoring error rates and response times. The test identifies the maximum number of concurrent users the system can handle before experiencing significant errors or unacceptable response times (>5 seconds or >10% error rate).

**Connection Stress Testing** attempts to open a large number of simultaneous connections to identify connection limits and connection pool exhaustion points. This test helps validate that the system can handle connection bursts and that connection pooling is properly configured.

**Memory Stress Testing** continuously makes requests that return large payloads to stress memory allocation and garbage collection. This test helps identify memory leaks, inefficient memory usage, and garbage collection bottlenecks that may not be apparent under normal load.

**Recovery Testing** validates that the system can recover to normal operation after experiencing stress. This test applies high stress, allows a cool-down period, then verifies that the system returns to normal performance levels. This is critical for ensuring that temporary traffic spikes don't cause lasting degradation.

## Running Tests

### Load Testing

Execute the comprehensive load test suite:

```bash
npm run load-test [base-url]
```

The load test runs four scenarios sequentially:

1. **Sustained Load Test**: 20 concurrent users for 30 seconds
2. **Ramp-Up Test**: Gradually increase from 0 to 50 users over 30 seconds, maintain for 30 seconds
3. **Spike Test**: Normal load (10 users) → spike (50 users) → return to normal
4. **User Journey Test**: 10 users each completing 5 full user journeys

The test generates detailed reports in both JSON and Markdown formats, including:
- Total requests and success rate
- Response time statistics (min, max, avg, median, P95, P99)
- Throughput measurements
- Error analysis
- Performance recommendations

### Stress Testing

Execute the stress test suite:

```bash
npm run stress-test [base-url]
```

The stress test runs four scenarios:

1. **Breaking Point Test**: Incrementally increase load from 10 to 300 users (or until failure)
2. **Connection Stress Test**: Attempt 1000 simultaneous connections
3. **Memory Stress Test**: 100 concurrent users making continuous requests for 30 seconds
4. **Recovery Test**: Apply stress, cool down, verify recovery

The test generates reports including:
- Breaking point (maximum concurrent users before failure)
- Maximum successful load level
- Connection capacity
- Recovery capability
- Specific recommendations based on results

## Interpreting Results

### Load Test Metrics

**Success Rate**: The percentage of requests that completed successfully (HTTP 2xx status). A success rate above 99% is excellent, 95-99% is acceptable, and below 95% indicates issues that need investigation.

**Average Response Time**: The mean response time across all requests. Target values depend on endpoint complexity, but generally:
- < 200ms: Excellent
- 200-500ms: Good
- 500-1000ms: Acceptable
- \> 1000ms: Needs optimization

**P95 and P99 Response Times**: The 95th and 99th percentile response times indicate worst-case performance for most users. These metrics are often more important than average response time because they represent the experience of users with slower responses. Target P95 < 500ms and P99 < 1000ms.

**Throughput**: Requests per second the system can handle. Higher throughput indicates better capacity. Compare throughput across different load levels to identify when performance begins to degrade.

**Max Concurrency**: The maximum number of concurrent requests observed during the test. This helps validate that the system is actually handling the expected concurrency level.

### Stress Test Metrics

**Breaking Point**: The number of concurrent users at which the system begins to fail (error rate > 10% or average response time > 5 seconds). This represents the absolute maximum capacity of the current infrastructure.

**Max Successful Load**: The highest load level at which the system maintained acceptable performance. This should be used as the basis for capacity planning, with appropriate safety margins.

**Connection Success Rate**: The percentage of connection attempts that succeeded in the connection stress test. Rates below 90% indicate connection pool or network limitations.

**Recovery Status**: Whether the system successfully recovered to normal performance after stress. Failed recovery indicates resource leaks, connection exhaustion, or other issues that persist after load decreases.

## Performance Targets

### Response Time Targets

The platform establishes the following response time targets based on endpoint type:

**Simple Endpoints** (health checks, static content):
- Average: < 50ms
- P95: < 100ms
- P99: < 200ms

**Standard API Endpoints** (user lists, simple queries):
- Average: < 200ms
- P95: < 500ms
- P99: < 1000ms

**Complex Endpoints** (analytics, aggregations):
- Average: < 500ms
- P95: < 1000ms
- P99: < 2000ms

**Database-Intensive Endpoints**:
- Average: < 300ms
- P95: < 750ms
- P99: < 1500ms

### Capacity Targets

**Concurrent Users**: The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users with acceptable performance. Breaking point should be significantly higher (3x-5x) to provide safety margin.

**Requests Per Second**: Simple endpoints should handle > 1000 req/s, standard endpoints > 500 req/s, complex endpoints > 100 req/s.

**Success Rate**: Maintain > 99% success rate under normal load, > 95% under peak load.

**Recovery Time**: System should recover to normal performance within 60 seconds after stress ends.

## Best Practices

### Before Testing

**Prepare Test Environment**: Ensure the test environment closely mirrors production configuration. Use production-equivalent hardware, database sizes, and network conditions. Populate the database with realistic data volumes to ensure accurate results.

**Establish Baseline**: Run initial tests to establish baseline performance metrics. This provides a reference point for comparing future tests and identifying performance regressions.

**Monitor Resources**: Set up monitoring for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network utilization during tests. This helps identify resource bottlenecks and capacity limits.

**Isolate Test Environment**: Run tests in an isolated environment to prevent interference from other processes or users. Ensure consistent test conditions across multiple test runs.

### During Testing

**Start Small**: Begin with low load levels and gradually increase. This helps identify performance issues at lower loads before attempting high-stress scenarios.

**Monitor Continuously**: Watch system metrics in real-time during tests. Look for signs of resource exhaustion, error rate increases, or response time degradation.

**Allow Cool-Down**: Provide adequate cool-down periods between tests to allow the system to return to baseline state. This prevents one test from affecting the results of subsequent tests.

**Document Observations**: Record any anomalies, errors, or unexpected behavior observed during testing. This information is valuable for troubleshooting and optimization.

### After Testing

**Analyze Results**: Review test reports thoroughly, looking for patterns in errors, response time degradation, and resource utilization. Compare results against targets and previous test runs.

**Identify Bottlenecks**: Use test results and monitoring data to identify specific bottlenecks (database queries, API endpoints, resource limits). Prioritize optimization efforts based on impact.

**Implement Improvements**: Address identified issues through optimization, caching, scaling, or architectural changes. Re-test after improvements to validate effectiveness.

**Update Capacity Plans**: Use test results to inform capacity planning and scaling strategies. Ensure adequate safety margins between normal load and breaking point.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### High Response Times

**Symptoms**: Average response times exceed targets, P95/P99 significantly higher than average.

**Possible Causes**:
- Slow database queries (missing indexes, inefficient queries)
- Insufficient caching
- CPU or memory bottlenecks
- Network latency
- Inefficient algorithms

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Review slow query logs to identify problematic database queries
2. Check CPU and memory utilization during tests
3. Profile application code to identify CPU-intensive operations
4. Review caching hit rates and effectiveness
5. Analyze network latency between components

**Solutions**:
- Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize slow queries and inefficient code
- Scale vertically (more CPU/memory) or horizontally (more instances)
- Use CDN for static assets

### High Error Rates

**Symptoms**: Success rate below targets, increasing error rates under load.

**Possible Causes**:
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Memory exhaustion
- Timeout issues
- Application bugs triggered under load
- Resource limits (file descriptors, network connections)

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Review error logs for specific error messages
2. Check database connection pool utilization
3. Monitor memory usage and garbage collection
4. Review timeout configurations
5. Check system resource limits (ulimit, connection limits)

**Solutions**:
- Increase database connection pool size
- Optimize memory usage and fix memory leaks
- Adjust timeout values appropriately
- Fix application bugs
- Increase system resource limits
- Implement connection queuing and retry logic

### Performance Degradation Over Time

**Symptoms**: Performance acceptable initially but degrades during sustained load.

**Possible Causes**:
- Memory leaks
- Connection leaks
- Cache bloat
- Log file growth
- Database table bloat

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Monitor memory usage over time
2. Check for connection leaks (unclosed connections)
3. Review cache size and eviction policies
4. Monitor disk usage and log file sizes
5. Check database table sizes and index health

**Solutions**:
- Fix memory leaks in application code
- Ensure proper connection cleanup
- Implement cache size limits and eviction
- Configure log rotation
- Perform database maintenance (vacuum, reindex)

### Poor Recovery After Stress

**Symptoms**: System doesn't return to normal performance after load decreases.

**Possible Causes**:
- Resource leaks not cleaned up
- Persistent connection issues
- Database in degraded state
- Cache corruption
- Background processes still running

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check for lingering connections or processes
2. Review database health and connection pool
3. Monitor resource usage after load decreases
4. Check cache state and validity
5. Review background job queues

**Solutions**:
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Add health checks and automatic recovery
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Clear and rebuild caches if necessary
- Ensure background jobs complete or timeout properly

## Continuous Testing

### Integration with CI/CD

Load and stress tests should be integrated into the continuous integration and deployment pipeline to catch performance regressions early.

**Pre-Deployment Testing**: Run abbreviated load tests before deploying to production. Use a subset of the full test suite that completes in reasonable time (5-10 minutes) while still validating critical performance characteristics.

**Scheduled Testing**: Run comprehensive load and stress tests on a regular schedule (daily or weekly) against staging environments. This provides ongoing performance monitoring and early detection of degradation.

**Performance Baselines**: Maintain baseline performance metrics and automatically compare test results against baselines. Alert when performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds (e.g., 20% slower than baseline).

### Automated Reporting

Configure automated reporting to share test results with the team:

**Slack/Email Notifications**: Send test summaries to team communication channels, highlighting any failures or performance degradation.

**Dashboard Integration**: Display key performance metrics on team dashboards for ongoing visibility.

**Trend Analysis**: Track performance metrics over time to identify gradual degradation and validate optimization efforts.
