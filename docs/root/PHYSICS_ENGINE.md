# AETHERIAL Platform Physics Engine

## 1. Objective

To create a high-performance and realistic physics engine that can handle a large number of dynamic objects in the AETHERIAL metaverse. This engine will be responsible for simulating gravity, collisions, and other physical forces, making the world a more immersive and believable experience.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Physics Library

- **Concept:** We will use the `cannon-es` library as the core of our physics engine. `cannon-es` is a lightweight and high-performance 3D physics engine for the web, and it is a well-maintained fork of the original `cannon.js`.
- **Implementation:** We will create a wrapper around `cannon-es` to simplify its integration with our rendering engine and game logic.

### b. Collision Detection

- **Concept:** The physics engine will be responsible for detecting collisions between objects in the scene.
- **Implementation:** We will use a combination of broadphase and narrowphase collision detection algorithms to efficiently detect collisions between a large number of objects.

### c. Integration with Rendering Engine

- **Concept:** The physics engine will be tightly integrated with our `three.js`-based rendering engine.
- **Implementation:** The position and orientation of each object in the rendering engine will be updated on each frame to match the corresponding object in the physics engine.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **cannon-es Integration:** Integrate `cannon-es` into our client-side application.
2.  **Physics World:** Create a physics world and add bodies for the objects in the scene.
3.  **Synchronization:** Synchronize the state of the physics world with the rendering engine.
4.  **Interaction:** Implement a system for applying forces to objects in the scene.
5.  **Optimization:** Optimize the physics engine for performance and scalability.
