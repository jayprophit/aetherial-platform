# AETHERIAL Platform Voice and Text Chat

## 1. Objective

To provide a seamless and real-time communication experience for users, including private messaging, group chat, and voice channels. This will foster a strong sense of community and enable more effective collaboration and social interaction.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Text Chat

- **Concept:** Real-time text chat in private messages, group chats, and public channels.
- **Implementation:** We will leverage our existing WebSocket server to handle the real-time delivery of text messages. Messages will be stored in the database for persistence.

### b. Voice Chat

- **Concept:** High-quality, low-latency voice chat in private calls and dedicated voice channels.
- **Implementation:** We will use WebRTC to establish peer-to-peer audio connections between users. A signaling server will be used to facilitate the initial connection setup.

## 3. Database Schema

```sql
-- Chat Messages
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  sender_id INT NOT NULL,
  recipient_id INT, -- For private messages
  channel_id INT, -- For group/public channels
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (recipient_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (channel_id) REFERENCES channels(id) -- Assuming a channels table exists
);
```

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Database Schema:** Update the database schema to include the `chat_messages` table.
2.  **Text Chat Service:** Create a service to manage the sending and receiving of text messages.
3.  **WebSocket Integration:** Integrate the text chat service with the WebSocket server.
4.  **WebRTC Signaling Server:** Implement a signaling server to facilitate WebRTC connections.
5.  **Frontend Integration:** Build the chat interface, including a contact list, chat windows, and voice channel UI elements for initiating voice calls.
