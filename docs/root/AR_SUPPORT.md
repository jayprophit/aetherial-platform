# AETHERIAL Platform AR Support

## 1. Objective

To create an AR support system that enables users to experience the AETHERIAL metaverse in augmented reality, blending the digital and physical worlds. This will be a powerful tool for creating immersive and interactive experiences, and it will also open up new possibilities for education, entertainment, and a wide range of other applications.

## 2. Core Components

### a. WebXR API

- **Concept:** We will use the WebXR API to create our AR experiences. The WebXR API is a web-based API that allows for the creation of VR and AR experiences that can be accessed through a web browser.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `@react-three/xr` library, which provides a set of React components for creating WebXR experiences.

### b. Marker-Based Tracking

- **Concept:** We will use marker-based tracking to anchor our AR content to the real world. Marker-based tracking is a technique that uses a physical marker, such as a QR code or a custom image, to determine the position and orientation of the user's device.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like `jsartoolkit5` or `ar.js` to implement marker-based tracking.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **WebXR Integration:** Integrate the `@react-three/xr` library into our client-side application.
2.  **Marker-Based Tracking:** Integrate a marker-based tracking library into our client-side application.
3.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for creating and managing AR experiences.
4.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for interacting with the AR support system.
