# AETHERIAL Platform: Advanced Encryption Strategy

**INCREMENT 107**

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive encryption strategy for the AETHERIAL platform, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and security of user data both at rest and in transit. Our approach is designed to meet and exceed industry best practices and comply with stringent regulatory requirements like GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS.

## 2. Encryption for Data in Transit

All communication between the client (browser, mobile app) and the AETHERIAL servers, as well as internal microservice communication, will be encrypted using industry-standard protocols.

-   **Protocol:** TLS 1.3 will be enforced as the minimum standard for all connections. Older versions (TLS 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, and all SSL versions) will be disabled to protect against known vulnerabilities.
-   **Cipher Suites:** We will utilize a modern, secure set of cipher suites with a preference for algorithms that provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), such as `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`.
-   **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** The HSTS header will be implemented across the entire platform to ensure that browsers only ever connect to our servers using HTTPS. This mitigates protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.
-   **Certificate Management:** We will use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and automate certificate renewal to prevent expiration. We will also implement Certificate Stapling for improved performance and privacy.

## 3. Encryption for Data at Rest

Data at rest refers to data stored on our servers, including in databases, file storage, and backups. We will employ a multi-layered encryption strategy for data at rest.

### 3.1. Database Encryption

Sensitive user data stored in our PostgreSQL database will be encrypted at the application level before it is written to the database. This provides a stronger security posture than relying solely on full-disk or transparent database encryption.

-   **Encryption Algorithm:** We will use **AES-256-GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode). AES is a NIST-approved standard, and GCM provides both confidentiality and data authenticity.
-   **Key Management:**
    -   A unique **Data Encryption Key (DEK)** will be used for each sensitive data field for each user.
    -   Each DEK will be encrypted with a **Key Encryption Key (KEK)**.
    -   The KEKs will be managed by a dedicated Key Management Service (KMS), such as AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault. This ensures that the keys are stored securely and rotated regularly.
    -   The application will never have direct access to the plaintext KEKs.
-   **Fields to be Encrypted:**
    -   User Profile: `email`, `bio`, `mfaSecret`
    -   Personal Messages: `content`
    -   Other sensitive data identified during development.

### 3.2. File Storage Encryption

All user-uploaded files (avatars, documents, etc.) will be encrypted before being stored in our object storage (e.g., Amazon S3).

-   **Encryption:** Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) or KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS) will be used.
-   **Access Control:** Fine-grained access control policies will be in place to ensure that only authorized users and services can access the files.

### 3.3. Backup Encryption

All database and file storage backups will be encrypted using AES-256. Backup encryption keys will be managed separately from the primary data encryption keys.

## 4. Implementation Details

-   **Encryption Library:** We will use a well-vetted and maintained cryptography library, such as `crypto-js` or the native Node.js `crypto` module, for all application-level encryption.
-   **Encryption Service:** A dedicated `EncryptionService` will be created in the backend to handle all encryption and decryption operations. This service will be the only part of the application that interacts with the KMS.
-   **Data Access Layer:** The data access layer will be modified to automatically encrypt data when writing to the database and decrypt it when reading.

## 5. Policy & Compliance

-   **Key Rotation:** All encryption keys (DEKs and KEKs) will be rotated on a regular schedule.
-   **Auditing:** All access to the KMS and all encryption/decryption operations will be logged in the audit trail for security monitoring and compliance verification.
-   **Compliance:** This encryption strategy is designed to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA, and other relevant data protection regulations.
