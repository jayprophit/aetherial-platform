# AETHERIAL Platform Social Graph

## 1. Objective

To create a social graph that maps the relationships between users, and a social feed that displays content from a user's network. This will be the foundation of the social features of the platform.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Social Graph

- **Concept:** We will use a graph database to store and manage the social graph. A graph database is a type of NoSQL database that is optimized for storing and querying graph data.
- **Implementation:** We will use a graph database like Neo4j or Amazon Neptune.

### b. Social Graph Analysis

- **Concept:** We will use social graph analysis to identify communities, influencers, and other key players in the social network.
- **Implementation:** We will use a graph analysis library like `js-graph-algorithms` or `graphology` to perform social graph analysis.

### c. Social Feed

- **Concept:** The social feed will display a personalized stream of content from a user's network. The content will be ranked based on a variety of factors, such as the user's relationship with the content creator, the popularity of the content, and the user's past interactions with similar content.
- **Implementation:** We will use a combination of our recommender system and our social graph to generate the social feed.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Graph Database Setup:** Set up a graph database and create the necessary nodes and edges.
2.  **Social Graph Service:** Create a service to manage the social graph.
3.  **Social Graph Analysis:** Implement social graph analysis algorithms.
4.  **Social Feed Service:** Create a service to generate the social feed.
5.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for retrieving social graph data and the social feed.
6.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for visualizing the social graph and for displaying the social feed.
