# AETHERIAL Platform Decentralized Identity (DID) Strategy

## 1. Objective

To empower users with self-sovereign identity by implementing a Decentralized Identity (DID) system. This will give users control over their own digital identity and data, allowing them to manage their identity and share verifiable information without relying on a centralized provider.

## 2. Core Components

### a. DID Method

- **Concept:** We will use the `did:key` method for its simplicity and ease of implementation. The `did:key` method allows for the creation of DIDs from a public key, without the need for a blockchain or other distributed ledger. This is a great starting point for our DID implementation, and we can add support for other DID methods in the future.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `did-jwt` and `did-resolver` libraries to create and manage `did:key` DIDs.

### b. Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

- **Concept:** We will use Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to represent user attributes, such as their username, email address, and age. VCs are tamper-proof digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `did-jwt-vc` library to create, issue, and verify VCs.

### c. DID-based Authentication

- **Concept:** Users will be able to log in to the AETHERIAL platform using their DID.
- **Implementation:** We will implement a DID-based authentication flow that uses a challenge-response mechanism to verify the user's control over their DID.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **DID Library Integration:** Integrate the `did-jwt`, `did-resolver`, and `key-did-resolver` libraries into our server-side application.
2.  **Database Schema:** Update the database schema to include a table for storing user DIDs.
3.  **DID Service:** Create a service to manage the creation, resolution, and verification of DIDs and VCs.
4.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for managing DIDs and VCs.
5.  **Authentication Flow:** Implement a DID-based authentication flow.
6.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for managing DIDs and VCs.
