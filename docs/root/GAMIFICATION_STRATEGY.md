# AETHERIAL Platform Gamification Strategy

## 1. Objective

To increase user engagement, retention, and desired behaviors by incorporating game-like mechanics into the AETHERIAL platform. This strategy will reward users for their contributions and create a more compelling and interactive experience.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### a. Points System (Aether Points - AP)

- **Concept:** Users earn Aether Points (AP) for performing various actions on the platform.
- **Purpose:** AP serves as a measure of a user's overall contribution and activity.
- **Actions & Points:**
    - Creating a post: 10 AP
    - Commenting on a post: 5 AP
    - Liking a post: 1 AP
    - Adding a friend: 25 AP
    - Completing a profile section: 50 AP
    - Daily login: 5 AP

### b. Badges & Achievements

- **Concept:** Users unlock badges for reaching milestones and completing specific challenges.
- **Purpose:** Badges provide users with a sense of accomplishment and public recognition.
- **Examples:**
    - **"Pioneer":** Joined AETHERIAL within the first month of launch.
    - **"Socialite":** Acquired 100 friends.
    - **"Thought Leader":** Received 1,000 likes on posts.
    - **"Creator":** Published 50 posts.

### c. Leaderboards

- **Concept:** Leaderboards will rank users based on their Aether Points.
- **Purpose:** To foster friendly competition and provide a clear goal for users to strive for.
- **Types:**
    - **All-Time Leaderboard:** Ranks users based on their total accumulated AP.
    - **Weekly Leaderboard:** Ranks users based on the AP earned in the current week.

## 3. Database Schema

```sql
-- User Points
CREATE TABLE user_points (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  points INT NOT NULL,
  action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Badges
CREATE TABLE badges (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  icon_url VARCHAR(255)
);

-- User Badges
CREATE TABLE user_badges (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  badge_id INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (badge_id) REFERENCES badges(id)
);
```

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Database Schema:** Update the database schema to include the `user_points`, `badges`, and `user_badges` tables.
2.  **Gamification Service:** Create a service to handle the logic for awarding points and badges.
3.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints to retrieve user points, badges, and leaderboard data.
4.  **Frontend Integration:** Integrate the gamification features into the user interface, including:
    - Displaying user points and badges on their profile.
    - A dedicated page for leaderboards.
    - Notifications when a user earns a new badge.
