# AETHERIAL Platform RTS Game Engine

## 1. Objective

To create a flexible and scalable real-time strategy (RTS) game engine that can support a variety of turn-based and real-time multiplayer games on the AETHERIAL platform. This engine will handle game state management, player actions, and real-time communication.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Game Loop

- **Concept:** The core of the engine, responsible for updating the game state at a regular interval.
- **Implementation:** A server-side game loop will run for each active game instance, processing player actions and updating the game state.

### b. State Management

- **Concept:** The game state will be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and will represent the current state of the game, including unit positions, player resources, etc.
- **Implementation:** The game state will be stored in memory for active games and persisted to the database for inactive games.

### c. Networking

- **Concept:** Real-time communication between the server and clients will be handled by our existing WebSocket server.
- **Implementation:** Player actions will be sent to the server via WebSockets, and game state updates will be broadcast back to all players in the game.

## 3. Database Schema

```sql
-- Games
CREATE TABLE games (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  game_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'chess', 'rts_demo'
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- e.g., 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed'
  game_state JSON,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Game Players
CREATE TABLE game_players (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  game_id INT NOT NULL,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  team INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Database Schema:** Update the database schema to include the `games` and `game_players` tables.
2.  **Game Engine Service:** Create a service to manage game creation, state updates, and player actions.
3.  **WebSocket Integration:** Integrate the game engine with the WebSocket server to handle real-time communication.
4.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for creating and joining games.
5.  **Demo Game:** Create a simple demo game to showcase the engine's capabilities.
