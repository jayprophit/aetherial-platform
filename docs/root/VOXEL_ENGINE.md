# AETHERIAL Platform Voxel Engine

## 1. Objective

To create a high-performance and scalable voxel engine that allows for the creation, manipulation, and rendering of large-scale, dynamic 3D worlds. This engine will be a core component of the AETHERIAL metaverse, empowering users to build and share their own creations.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Chunking

- **Concept:** The world will be divided into fixed-size chunks (e.g., 16x16x16 voxels) to enable efficient loading and unloading of world data.
- **Implementation:** Only the chunks that are within the player's view distance will be loaded and rendered, allowing for virtually infinite worlds.

### b. Meshing

- **Concept:** A greedy meshing algorithm will be used to generate an optimized mesh for each chunk, reducing the number of vertices and improving rendering performance.
- **Implementation:** The meshing algorithm will group adjacent voxels of the same type into larger rectangular prisms, significantly reducing the number of faces that need to be rendered.

### c. Data Management

- **Concept:** Voxel data will be stored in a compressed format to reduce memory usage and storage requirements.
- **Implementation:** We will use a combination of run-length encoding (RLE) and other compression techniques to efficiently store the voxel data for each chunk.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Voxel Engine Service:** Create a service to manage the creation, loading, and saving of voxel worlds.
2.  **Chunking System:** Implement a chunking system to divide the world into manageable pieces.
3.  **Greedy Meshing:** Implement a greedy meshing algorithm to generate optimized meshes for each chunk.
4.  **Data Compression:** Implement a data compression scheme for storing voxel data.
5.  **3D World Integration:** Integrate the voxel engine with the 3D world rendering engine to display and interact with voxel worlds.
