# AETHERIAL Platform Procedural Content Generation (PCG) Strategy

## 1. Objective

To create a robust and flexible Procedural Content Generation (PCG) system that can automatically generate a wide variety of game content, including landscapes, dungeons, quests, and items. This will provide a unique and ever-changing experience for players, encouraging exploration and replayability.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Landscape Generation

- **Concept:** Generate realistic and varied landscapes using noise functions.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like `simplex-noise` to generate height maps, which will then be used to create terrain with mountains, valleys, and rivers.

### b. Dungeon Generation

- **Concept:** Generate complex and interesting dungeons using graph-based algorithms.
- **Implementation:** We will use a graph-based approach to create a network of rooms and corridors, ensuring that each dungeon is unique and challenging.

### c. Quest & Item Generation

- **Concept:** Generate unique and engaging quests and items using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **Implementation:** We will use an LLM to generate quest descriptions, objectives, and rewards, as well as unique item names, descriptions, and stats.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **PCG Service:** Create a service to manage the generation of all types of procedural content.
2.  **Noise Library Integration:** Integrate a noise library for landscape generation.
3.  **Graph Library Integration:** Integrate a graph library for dungeon generation.
4.  **LLM Integration:** Integrate with an LLM for quest and item generation.
5.  **Game Engine Integration:** Integrate the PCG service with the game engine to allow for the dynamic generation of game content.
