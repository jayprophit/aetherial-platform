# AETHERIAL Platform Monitoring and Alerting

## 1. Objective

To create a monitoring and alerting system that allows us to monitor the health of the platform and to send alerts when issues are detected.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Prometheus

- **Concept:** We will use Prometheus to collect and store metrics from our application. Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that is designed for reliability and scalability.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `prom-client` library to expose metrics from our application to Prometheus.

### b. Grafana

- **Concept:** We will use Grafana to visualize our metrics and to create dashboards. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability that allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored.
- **Implementation:** We will use Grafana to create dashboards that visualize our metrics.

### c. Alertmanager

- **Concept:** We will use Alertmanager to handle alerts. Alertmanager is a component of Prometheus that is responsible for handling alerts, including deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver.
- **Implementation:** We will use Alertmanager to send alerts to our team when issues are detected.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Prometheus Setup:** Set up a Prometheus server to collect and store metrics from our application.
2.  **Grafana Setup:** Set up a Grafana server to visualize our metrics and to create dashboards.
3.  **Alertmanager Setup:** Set up an Alertmanager server to handle alerts.
4.  **Metrics Exposition:** Use the `prom-client` library to expose metrics from our application to Prometheus.
5.  **Dashboards:** Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize our metrics.
6.  **Alerting Rules:** Create alerting rules in Prometheus to send alerts to our team when issues are detected.
