## 🎓 Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why JWT for Authentication?
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across multiple servers
- No server-side session storage needed
- Industry standard
- Easy to implement and verify

### Why Drizzle ORM?
- Type-safe queries
- Better TypeScript integration than Prisma
- Lightweight and fast
- SQL-like syntax
- Excellent migration system

### Why React Context for State?
- Built-in to React
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for auth state
- Easy to understand
- Can upgrade to Redux if needed

### Why Separate Backend/Frontend?
- Independent scaling
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain
- Can deploy separately
- API can serve multiple clients
