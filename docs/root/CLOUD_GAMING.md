# AETHERIAL Platform Cloud Gaming and Pixel Streaming

## 1. Objective

To create a cloud gaming and pixel streaming system that allows users to play high-end games on any device by streaming them from the cloud. This will make high-end gaming more accessible to a wider audience, and it will also enable new types of gaming experiences that are not possible with traditional gaming hardware.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Virtual Machine

- **Concept:** We will use a virtual machine (VM) to run the games in the cloud. The VM will be equipped with a powerful GPU, allowing it to run even the most demanding games at high settings.
- **Implementation:** We will use a cloud-based VM provider, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### b. Screen Capture

- **Concept:** We will use a screen capture library to capture the video and audio from the game running on the VM.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like `node-screencapture` or `robotjs` to capture the screen.

### c. WebRTC

- **Concept:** We will use WebRTC to stream the captured video and audio to the user's device.
- **Implementation:** We will use our existing WebRTC implementation, which is based on the `simple-peer` library.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **VM Setup:** Set up a VM with a powerful GPU and install the necessary software.
2.  **Screen Capture:** Implement a screen capture solution to capture the video and audio from the game.
3.  **WebRTC Streaming:** Implement a WebRTC streaming solution to stream the captured video and audio to the user's device.
4.  **Input Handling:** Implement a solution to capture user input (e.g., keyboard and mouse events) and send it to the VM.
5.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for starting and stopping cloud gaming sessions.
6.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for managing cloud gaming sessions.
