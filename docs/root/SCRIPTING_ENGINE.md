# AETHERIAL Platform Scripting Engine

## 1. Objective

To create a secure and powerful scripting engine that allows users to create and share their own interactive content and game mechanics. This will be a key feature of the AETHERIAL metaverse, enabling a vibrant and user-driven ecosystem of content and experiences.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Scripting Language

- **Concept:** We will use Lua as our scripting language. Lua is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-learn scripting language that is widely used in game development.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `lua.js` library, which is a JavaScript port of the Lua interpreter. This will allow us to run Lua code directly in the browser.

### b. Sandboxing

- **Concept:** User-created scripts will be run in a sandboxed environment to prevent them from accessing sensitive APIs or interfering with the rest of the platform.
- **Implementation:** We will use a combination of techniques, such as Web Workers and a carefully designed API, to create a secure sandbox for running user scripts.

### c. API Exposure

- **Concept:** We will expose a limited and well-documented API to the scripting environment, allowing users to interact with the game world and create their own content.
- **Implementation:** The API will provide functions for creating and manipulating objects, responding to events, and creating custom UI elements.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **lua.js Integration:** Integrate `lua.js` into our client-side application.
2.  **Sandboxing:** Implement a secure sandbox for running user scripts.
3.  **API Design:** Design and implement a scripting API.
4.  **Script Editor:** Create a simple in-browser script editor for creating and editing scripts.
5.  **Script Sharing:** Implement a system for sharing and discovering user-created scripts.
