# AETHERIAL Platform Live Streaming and Video Conferencing

## 1. Objective

To create a live streaming and video conferencing system that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to an audience, and to participate in multi-user video conferences. This will be a key feature of the AETHERIAL metaverse, enabling a wide range of social and collaborative experiences.

## 2. Core Components

### a. WebRTC

- **Concept:** We will use WebRTC for our live streaming and video conferencing implementation. WebRTC is a free and open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `simple-peer` library to simplify the process of setting up and managing WebRTC peer-to-peer connections.

### b. Signaling Server

- **Concept:** A signaling server is required to coordinate the setup of WebRTC connections. The signaling server is responsible for exchanging metadata between peers, such as session control messages, error messages, and media metadata.
- **Implementation:** We will use our existing WebSocket server as our signaling server.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **simple-peer Integration:** Integrate the `simple-peer` library into our client-side application.
2.  **Signaling Server:** Extend our WebSocket server to handle signaling for WebRTC connections.
3.  **Live Streaming:** Implement a one-to-many live streaming feature.
4.  **Video Conferencing:** Implement a many-to-many video conferencing feature.
5.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for creating and joining live streams and video conferences.
6.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for managing live streams and video conferences.
