## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Best Practices Established

1. **Always authenticate first** - Check user state before API calls
2. **Loading states everywhere** - Better UX during data fetching
3. **Error handling is critical** - Display user-friendly error messages
4. **Type safety saves time** - TypeScript catches bugs early
5. **Incremental commits** - Small, focused changes are easier to track
6. **Test as you build** - Don't accumulate technical debt

### Code Patterns

**API Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
const [data, setData] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState('');

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const result = await api.resource.getAll();
      setData(result);
    } catch (err) {
      setError('Failed to load data');
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

**Authentication Check Pattern:**
```typescript
const { user } = useAuth();

const handleAction = async () => {
  if (!user) {
    setError('Please login to continue');
    return;
  }
  // Proceed with action
};
```

5. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance to verify (planned for INCREMENT 96-100)

### Mitigation Plan

- Address TypeScript errors during page integrations
- Run `pnpm audit fix` for dependencies
- Implement testing in Phase 4
- Performance optimization in Phase 4
- Accessibility audit in Phase 4
