# AETHERIAL Platform Recommender System

## 1. Objective

To create a recommender system that provides personalized content recommendations to users, helping them to discover new and interesting content on the platform. This will improve user engagement and retention.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Collaborative Filtering

- **Concept:** We will use a collaborative filtering approach to generate recommendations. Collaborative filtering works by finding users with similar tastes and then recommending content that those users have liked.
- **Implementation:** We will use a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which is a simple and effective way to generate recommendations.

### b. Matrix Factorization

- **Concept:** We will use matrix factorization to learn latent features for users and items. These latent features can then be used to generate more accurate recommendations.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like `implicit` or `surprise` to implement matrix factorization.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Data Collection:** Collect data on user interactions with content, such as likes, comments, and shares.
2.  **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm.
3.  **Matrix Factorization:** Implement a matrix factorization algorithm.
4.  **Recommendation Service:** Create a service to generate recommendations for users.
5.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for retrieving recommendations.
6.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for displaying recommendations.
