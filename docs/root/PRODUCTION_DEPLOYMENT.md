# AETHERIAL Platform Production Deployment Pipeline

## 1. Objective

To create a production deployment pipeline that automatically deploys the platform to a production environment. This will involve creating a new GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy the platform to a production environment.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Docker

- **Concept:** We will use Docker to containerize our application. Docker is a tool that allows for the creation of lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers that can run on any machine.
- **Implementation:** We will create a Dockerfile that defines our application's environment and dependencies.

### b. Cloud Provider

- **Concept:** We will use a cloud provider, such as AWS or Google Cloud, to host our application. A cloud provider is a company that provides a variety of cloud computing services, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.
- **Implementation:** We will use a cloud provider to create a virtual machine that will run our application.

### c. GitHub Actions

- **Concept:** We will use GitHub Actions to automate our deployment process. GitHub Actions is a tool that allows for the creation of custom workflows that can be triggered by a variety of events, such as a push to a repository.
- **Implementation:** We will create a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically build our Docker image and deploy it to our cloud provider.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Dockerfile:** Create a Dockerfile that defines our application's environment and dependencies.
2.  **Cloud Provider Setup:** Set up a cloud provider account and create a virtual machine that will run our application.
3.  **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically build our Docker image and deploy it to our cloud provider.
