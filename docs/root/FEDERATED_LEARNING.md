# AETHERIAL Platform Federated Learning

## 1. Objective

To create a privacy-preserving AI system that can train machine learning models on user data without the data ever leaving the user's device. This will be achieved through the implementation of a Federated Learning system.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Federated Learning Library

- **Concept:** We will use the `TensorFlow.js` library for our Federated Learning implementation. `TensorFlow.js` is a powerful and flexible library for machine learning in JavaScript, and it has built-in support for Federated Learning.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `tf.federated` API to create and manage our Federated Learning tasks.

### b. Model Training Process

- **Concept:** The model training process will be divided into a series of rounds. In each round, a random subset of users will be selected to participate in the training. The selected users will download the current model, train it on their local data, and then send the updated model weights back to the server. The server will then aggregate the model weights from all participating users to create a new global model.
- **Implementation:** We will implement a server-side component to manage the model training process, and a client-side component to handle the model training on the user's device.

### c. Privacy-Preserving Techniques

- **Concept:** We will use a variety of privacy-preserving techniques to protect user data, such as differential privacy and secure aggregation.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `tf.privacy` API to implement differential privacy, and we will use a secure aggregation protocol to ensure that the server can only see the aggregated model weights, not the individual model weights from each user.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **TensorFlow.js Integration:** Integrate `TensorFlow.js` into our client-side and server-side applications.
2.  **Federated Learning Service:** Create a service to manage the Federated Learning tasks.
3.  **Model Training:** Implement the model training process on the client-side and server-side.
4.  **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Implement differential privacy and secure aggregation.
5.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for managing Federated Learning tasks.
6.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for visualizing the model training process and the performance of the trained models.
