# AETHERIAL Platform Blockchain Integration

## 1. Objective

To leverage blockchain technology to enable true ownership of digital assets, secure and transparent trading, and a decentralized creator economy. This will be achieved by representing virtual goods as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on a public blockchain.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Blockchain

- **Choice:** We will use a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, such as Polygon or Arbitrum, to ensure low transaction fees and fast confirmation times. This provides the security of Ethereum with the scalability needed for a high-volume platform.

### b. Smart Contracts

- **NFT Standard:** We will use the ERC-721 standard for our NFTs, which is the most widely adopted standard for unique digital assets.
- **Marketplace Contract:** A custom smart contract will be developed to handle the buying and selling of NFTs, ensuring that transactions are atomic and secure.

### c. Wallet Integration

- **Concept:** Users will connect their existing Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform to manage their NFTs.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like ethers.js to interact with users' wallets and sign transactions.

## 3. Database Schema

No new tables are required for the core blockchain integration. The `listings` table will be updated to include a reference to the NFT's contract address and token ID.

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Smart Contract Development:** Write and test the NFT and marketplace smart contracts using Hardhat.
2.  **Smart Contract Deployment:** Deploy the smart contracts to a test network (e.g., Polygon Mumbai).
3.  **Backend Integration:** Create a service to interact with the deployed smart contracts, including minting NFTs for new listings and processing sales.
4.  **Frontend Integration:** Update the marketplace to display NFT information and allow users to connect their wallets and purchase NFTs.
