# AETHERIAL Platform Content Moderation

## 1. Objective

To create a safe and positive environment for all users by automatically detecting and flagging inappropriate content, such as hate speech, harassment, and spam.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Profanity Filter

- **Concept:** We will use a profanity filter to automatically detect and flag common swear words and other inappropriate language.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `bad-words` library, which is a popular and well-maintained profanity filter for JavaScript.

### b. Machine Learning Model

- **Concept:** We will use a machine learning model to detect more nuanced forms of inappropriate content, such as hate speech and harassment.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `@tensorflow-models/toxicity` model, which is a pre-trained model that can detect a variety of toxic content types, including toxicity, severe toxicity, identity attack, insult, profanity, and threat.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Library Integration:** Integrate the `bad-words` and `@tensorflow-models/toxicity` libraries into our server-side application.
2.  **Content Moderation Service:** Create a service to manage the content moderation process.
3.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for flagging content and for retrieving the moderation status of content.
4.  **Integration with Posts and Comments:** Integrate the content moderation service with the posts and comments routes to automatically moderate user-generated content.
5.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for moderators to review and take action on flagged content.
