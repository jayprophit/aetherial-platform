## Security Overview

The AETHERIAL platform implements a comprehensive, defense-in-depth security strategy designed to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity. This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and procedures implemented across the platform.

### Security Principles

The platform is built on the following core security principles:

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented throughout the system, ensuring that if one layer is compromised, additional layers provide continued protection. This includes network security, application security, data security, and physical security measures.

**Least Privilege**: All users, services, and processes operate with the minimum level of access required to perform their functions. This principle is enforced through role-based access control (RBAC) and granular permission systems that limit potential damage from compromised accounts.

**Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default, and secure configurations are applied automatically. Users must explicitly opt-in to less secure options when necessary, with clear warnings about the implications.

**Zero Trust**: The platform assumes no implicit trust and verifies every request, regardless of source. All access requests are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted, even for internal communications between services.

**Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations are integrated into every aspect of the platform from the ground up, not added as an afterthought. Data minimization, purpose limitation, and user control are fundamental to the architecture.

## Security Architecture

The AETHERIAL platform employs a multi-layered security architecture that protects against various threat vectors.

### Application Layer Security

At the application layer, the platform implements comprehensive input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks. All user inputs are validated against strict schemas, and potentially dangerous content is sanitized before processing. The application uses parameterized queries exclusively to prevent SQL injection, and all HTML output is properly escaped to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The platform implements Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded, significantly reducing the risk of XSS and data injection attacks. Security headers including X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security are configured to provide additional protection against common web vulnerabilities.

### Transport Layer Security

All communications between clients and servers are encrypted using TLS 1.3, the latest version of the Transport Layer Security protocol. The platform uses strong cipher suites and perfect forward secrecy to ensure that even if encryption keys are compromised in the future, past communications remain secure.

Certificate pinning is implemented for mobile applications to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers ensure that browsers always use HTTPS connections. The platform also implements Certificate Transparency monitoring to detect and respond to fraudulent certificates.

### Data Layer Security

Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factors, and sensitive fields such as payment information are encrypted using AES-256. Database connections are encrypted, and access is restricted to specific application services through firewall rules and network segmentation.

### Infrastructure Security

The platform infrastructure is designed with security zones and network segmentation to limit the blast radius of potential breaches. Public-facing web servers are isolated from internal services and databases, with strict firewall rules controlling communication between zones. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices ensure consistent and secure configurations across all environments.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

The platform implements a robust authentication and authorization system that supports multiple authentication methods while maintaining security.

### Authentication Methods

**Password-Based Authentication**: Users can authenticate using email and password combinations. Passwords must meet complexity requirements including minimum length, character diversity, and prohibition of common passwords. The platform uses bcrypt for password hashing with a work factor that balances security and performance.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) provide an additional layer of security beyond passwords. Users can enable MFA using authenticator applications, and the platform enforces MFA for administrative accounts and sensitive operations.

**Biometric Authentication**: WebAuthn support enables passwordless authentication using biometric factors such as fingerprints or facial recognition. This provides enhanced security and improved user experience, particularly on mobile devices.

**Decentralized Identity (DID)**: The platform supports decentralized identifiers, allowing users to maintain control over their digital identities without relying on centralized authorities. This enhances privacy and gives users greater autonomy over their authentication credentials.

### Authorization Model

The platform implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions. Users are assigned roles that determine their access to resources and operations. Permissions are checked at multiple levels including API endpoints, database queries, and UI components to ensure consistent enforcement.

Authorization decisions are made based on the principle of least privilege, with explicit allow rules required for access. The system maintains comprehensive audit logs of all authorization decisions, enabling detection of unauthorized access attempts and compliance reporting.

### Session Management

User sessions are managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with appropriate expiration times. Access tokens have short lifespans (15 minutes) to limit the window of opportunity for token theft, while refresh tokens enable seamless session extension without requiring frequent re-authentication. Refresh tokens are stored securely in httpOnly cookies to prevent access by client-side JavaScript.

The platform implements token rotation, issuing new refresh tokens with each use and invalidating old tokens. This ensures that stolen refresh tokens have limited utility. Session invalidation is immediate upon logout, and the platform maintains a token blacklist to prevent use of revoked tokens before their natural expiration.

## Data Protection

Protecting user data is a fundamental priority for the AETHERIAL platform, implemented through multiple technical and procedural controls.

### Encryption

**Data in Transit**: All data transmitted between clients and servers is encrypted using TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites. This includes API requests, WebSocket connections, and file uploads. The platform enforces HTTPS for all connections and implements HSTS to prevent downgrade attacks.

**Data at Rest**: Sensitive data stored in databases is encrypted using AES-256 encryption. This includes personally identifiable information (PII), payment information, and authentication credentials. Encryption keys are managed separately from the encrypted data and rotated regularly according to security policies.

**Field-Level Encryption**: Particularly sensitive fields such as social security numbers or payment card information are encrypted at the field level, providing an additional layer of protection even if database access is compromised.

### Data Minimization

The platform collects only the minimum data necessary to provide services, adhering to privacy by design principles. Optional data collection requires explicit user consent, and users can review and delete their data at any time. Data retention policies ensure that data is not kept longer than necessary, with automatic deletion after specified periods.

### Backup and Recovery

Regular encrypted backups are performed to ensure data availability and business continuity. Backups are stored in geographically distributed locations with restricted access. The platform maintains both online and offline backups to protect against ransomware and other destructive attacks. Backup restoration procedures are tested regularly to ensure reliability.

## API Security

The platform's API implements multiple security controls to protect against unauthorized access and abuse.

### Authentication and Authorization

All API endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens, with the exception of public endpoints such as registration and password reset. Authorization checks are performed for every request, ensuring that users can only access resources they have permission to view or modify.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented at multiple levels to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation. Per-IP rate limiting prevents distributed attacks, while per-user rate limiting prevents individual account abuse. Different rate limits are applied based on user tier and endpoint sensitivity, with more restrictive limits for expensive operations.

### Input Validation

All API inputs are validated against strict schemas before processing. Request body size limits prevent memory exhaustion attacks, and file upload validation ensures that only expected file types and sizes are accepted. Invalid requests are rejected with appropriate error messages that don't leak sensitive information about the system.

### API Versioning

The platform uses API versioning to enable security updates without breaking existing integrations. Deprecated API versions are supported for a transition period with clear communication about security improvements in newer versions.

### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow requests only from trusted domains. The platform does not use wildcard CORS origins in production, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests. Preflight requests are properly handled, and credentials are only included in same-origin requests.

---

## Network Security

Network security controls protect the platform infrastructure and limit the impact of potential breaches.

### Firewall Configuration

Strict firewall rules are implemented at multiple levels, including cloud provider security groups, host-based firewalls, and application-level access controls. Only necessary ports are exposed to the internet, with administrative interfaces restricted to specific IP addresses or VPN access.

### DDoS Protection

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection is implemented through cloud provider services and content delivery networks (CDN). Traffic is analyzed for suspicious patterns, and automatic mitigation is triggered when attacks are detected. Rate limiting and connection limits provide additional protection against application-layer attacks.

### Network Segmentation

The infrastructure is divided into security zones with controlled communication between zones. Public-facing web servers are isolated from internal services and databases, with strict firewall rules governing inter-zone traffic. This limits the blast radius of potential breaches and prevents lateral movement by attackers.

### Intrusion Detection

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and known attack signatures. Alerts are generated for potential security incidents, enabling rapid response. The platform also implements host-based intrusion detection to monitor system-level activities.

---

## Security Testing

Comprehensive security testing is performed throughout the development lifecycle and in production.

### Automated Security Scanning

The platform includes automated security scanning tools that run as part of the continuous integration pipeline. These tools perform static analysis of code, dependency vulnerability scanning, and configuration validation. Security issues are flagged before code is merged, preventing vulnerabilities from reaching production.

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Source code is analyzed for security vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, and insecure cryptographic implementations. Custom rules are configured to detect platform-specific security requirements.

**Dependency Scanning**: All dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities using npm audit and third-party services. Automated pull requests are created to update vulnerable dependencies, and critical vulnerabilities block deployment until resolved.

### Penetration Testing

Regular penetration testing is performed by both internal security teams and external security firms. Testing includes both automated scanning and manual testing by experienced security researchers. The platform also operates a bug bounty program (INCREMENT 165) that incentivizes responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.

Penetration testing covers the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and platform-specific attack vectors. Testing is performed in dedicated environments that mirror production configurations without exposing real user data. Findings are prioritized based on severity and exploitability, with critical issues addressed immediately.

### Security Audit Scripts

The platform includes custom security audit scripts that can be run on-demand or as part of scheduled checks. These scripts validate security configurations, check for common misconfigurations, and verify that security controls are functioning as expected.

```bash
# Run security audit
npm run security:audit

# Run penetration tests
npm run security:pentest
```

## Incident Response

The platform maintains a comprehensive incident response plan to ensure rapid and effective response to security incidents.

### Incident Detection

Security incidents are detected through multiple channels including automated monitoring systems, security alerts from scanning tools, user reports, and bug bounty submissions. All potential incidents are logged and triaged based on severity and potential impact.

### Response Procedures

When a security incident is detected, the incident response team is immediately notified through automated alerting systems. The team follows documented procedures to contain the incident, investigate the root cause, remediate the vulnerability, and restore normal operations.

**Containment**: Immediate actions are taken to prevent further damage, which may include disabling compromised accounts, blocking malicious IP addresses, or temporarily disabling affected features.

**Investigation**: The incident is thoroughly investigated to understand the attack vector, scope of compromise, and potential data exposure. Forensic analysis is performed on affected systems, and all findings are documented.

**Remediation**: Vulnerabilities are patched, compromised credentials are rotated, and affected systems are restored from clean backups. Security controls are enhanced to prevent similar incidents in the future.

**Communication**: Affected users are notified in accordance with legal requirements and company policy. Transparency is maintained while protecting sensitive details that could aid attackers.

### Post-Incident Review

After incident resolution, a comprehensive post-incident review is conducted to identify lessons learned and improve security posture. The review examines the incident timeline, response effectiveness, and opportunities for improvement. Findings are incorporated into updated security procedures and training materials.
