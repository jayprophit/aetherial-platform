# AETHERIAL Platform - Accessibility Guide

## Overview

The AETHERIAL platform is committed to providing an inclusive experience for all users, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use. This document outlines our accessibility implementation, compliance with international standards, and best practices for maintaining accessibility as the platform evolves.

---

## Compliance Standards

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA

The platform achieves **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance**, meeting the internationally recognized standard for web accessibility. This ensures the platform is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities, including:

**Visual Disabilities**: The platform supports screen readers, provides sufficient color contrast, allows text resizing up to 200%, and includes alternative text for all meaningful images. Users with low vision benefit from high contrast modes, customizable text sizes, and clear visual focus indicators.

**Motor Disabilities**: Full keyboard navigation is available throughout the platform, with no keyboard traps and logical tab order. Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44 pixels) for users with limited dexterity. All interactive elements are accessible without requiring precise mouse control.

**Auditory Disabilities**: Visual alternatives are provided for all audio content. Captions and transcripts are available for multimedia content. Visual indicators supplement audio cues throughout the interface.

**Cognitive Disabilities**: The platform uses clear, consistent navigation patterns and simple language. Error messages are descriptive and provide guidance for correction. Users have control over time-sensitive content, and complex interactions include helpful instructions.

### Regulatory Compliance

The platform's accessibility implementation supports compliance with:

**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)**: Ensures equal access to digital services for users with disabilities in the United States.

**Section 508**: Meets federal accessibility standards for electronic and information technology in the United States.

**European Accessibility Act (EAA)**: Aligns with European Union accessibility requirements for digital products and services.

**UK Equality Act 2010**: Supports accessibility obligations for service providers in the United Kingdom.

## Accessibility Features

### Keyboard Navigation

Complete keyboard navigation is available throughout the platform, allowing users to access all functionality without a mouse.

**Tab Navigation**: The Tab key moves focus forward through interactive elements in a logical order. Shift+Tab moves focus backward. The focus order follows the visual layout and reading order, ensuring a predictable navigation experience.

**Arrow Key Navigation**: Arrow keys navigate within components like menus, tabs, and lists. Up/Down arrows typically move between items vertically, while Left/Right arrows move horizontally or between tabs. Home and End keys jump to the first and last items respectively.

**Enter and Space**: The Enter key activates buttons and links. Space activates buttons and toggles checkboxes. Both keys work consistently across all interactive elements.

**Escape Key**: The Escape key closes modals, dialogs, and dropdown menus, providing a consistent way to exit overlays and return to the main content.

**Skip to Main Content**: A "Skip to Main Content" link appears when users press Tab on page load, allowing keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation and jump directly to the main content area.

### Screen Reader Support

The platform is fully compatible with popular screen readers including NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.

**Semantic HTML**: Proper HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, article, aside, footer) provide structure that screen readers can interpret and announce to users.

**ARIA Attributes**: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and custom components. Labels, roles, states, and properties provide context that screen readers convey to users.

**Live Regions**: ARIA live regions announce dynamic content changes without requiring user action. Status messages, notifications, and real-time updates are announced automatically with appropriate politeness levels (polite for non-urgent updates, assertive for critical alerts).

**Alternative Text**: All meaningful images include descriptive alternative text. Decorative images use empty alt attributes to prevent unnecessary announcements. Complex images like charts and diagrams include extended descriptions.

**Form Labels**: Every form input has an associated label that screen readers announce when the input receives focus. Required fields are clearly marked, and error messages are associated with their corresponding inputs.

### Visual Accessibility

Visual design choices ensure content is perceivable by users with various visual abilities.

**Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Color is never the only means of conveying information; additional visual indicators like icons, patterns, or text labels are always provided.

**Text Resizing**: Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality. The layout reflows appropriately at different text sizes, and no horizontal scrolling is required at standard viewport widths.

**Focus Indicators**: All interactive elements display a clear, visible focus indicator (3px solid blue outline with 2px offset) when focused. The indicator has sufficient contrast against all backgrounds and is never hidden by CSS.

**High Contrast Mode**: The platform respects user preferences for high contrast mode, automatically adjusting colors and increasing outline widths for better visibility.

**Reduced Motion**: Users who prefer reduced motion (indicated by the prefers-reduced-motion media query) experience minimal or no animations. Transitions are reduced to near-instant, and auto-playing animations are disabled.

### Touch and Mobile Accessibility

Mobile users and those using touch interfaces benefit from accessibility features designed for touch interaction.

**Touch Target Size**: All interactive elements meet the minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels, ensuring they can be easily activated on touch screens without precise aiming.

**Spacing**: Adequate spacing between interactive elements prevents accidental activation of adjacent controls.

**Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. Content reflows at narrow widths (down to 320px) without horizontal scrolling or loss of functionality.

**Gesture Alternatives**: All gesture-based interactions have alternative activation methods. Swipe actions have button equivalents, and pinch-to-zoom is not disabled.

## Implementation Guide

### Using Accessibility Utilities

The platform provides comprehensive accessibility utilities in `/client/src/utils/accessibility.ts`. These utilities handle common accessibility patterns and ensure consistent implementation across components.

**Focus Management**: The `trapFocus` function confines keyboard focus within modals and dialogs, preventing users from tabbing to background content. The `getFocusableElements` function identifies all keyboard-accessible elements within a container. Use these when implementing overlays, modals, or complex interactive components.

**Screen Reader Announcements**: The `announceToScreenReader` function creates temporary live regions to announce dynamic content changes. Use this when content updates without page navigation, such as form submission results, loading states, or real-time notifications.

**Color Contrast Validation**: The `getContrastRatio` and `meetsContrastRequirement` functions calculate and validate color contrast ratios. Use these during design and development to ensure all color combinations meet WCAG requirements.

**Accessible Components**: Utility functions like `createAccessibleModal`, `createAccessibleButton`, and `createAccessibleFormField` generate properly structured, accessible components with correct ARIA attributes and keyboard support.

### Using React Hooks

React hooks in `/client/src/hooks/useAccessibility.ts` provide accessibility features for React components.

**useFocusTrap**: Automatically traps focus within a component when active. Essential for modals, dialogs, and dropdown menus to prevent keyboard users from accessing background content.

```typescript
const modalRef = useFocusTrap(isOpen);
return <div ref={modalRef} role="dialog">...</div>;
```

**useKeyboardNavigation**: Handles common keyboard interactions with callbacks for Enter, Escape, and arrow keys.

```typescript
useKeyboardNavigation(
  () => handleSubmit(),  // Enter
  () => handleClose(),   // Escape
  (direction) => navigate(direction)  // Arrows
);
```

**useReducedMotion**: Detects user preference for reduced motion and returns a boolean. Use this to conditionally disable or reduce animations.

```typescript
const reducedMotion = useReducedMotion();
const animationDuration = reducedMotion ? 0 : 300;
```

**useTabs**: Implements accessible tab navigation with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard support.

```typescript
const { activeTab, getTabProps, getTabPanelProps } = useTabs(3);
```

**useAriaLive**: Creates a live region for announcing dynamic content to screen readers.

```typescript
const { announce, LiveRegion } = useAriaLive('polite');
// Later: announce('Form submitted successfully');
```

### Styling for Accessibility

The accessibility stylesheet (`/client/src/styles/accessibility.css`) provides production-ready styles for accessible components.

**Screen Reader Only Content**: Use the `.sr-only` class for content that should be available to screen readers but hidden visually. This is useful for providing additional context or instructions that sighted users don't need.

**Focus Styles**: Focus indicators are automatically applied to all interactive elements using `:focus-visible`. The styles adapt to high contrast mode and provide sufficient contrast on all backgrounds.

**Responsive and Adaptive**: Styles respect user preferences for color scheme (light/dark), contrast level (normal/high), and motion (normal/reduced) through CSS media queries.

## Testing Accessibility

### Automated Testing

Run the automated accessibility test suite to verify WCAG compliance:

```bash
npm run accessibility:test
```

The test suite validates:
- Color contrast ratios for all color combinations
- Presence of required ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Form accessibility (labels, error messages)
- Heading hierarchy
- Touch target sizes
- Screen reader support
- Responsive design
- Motion and animation preferences

### Manual Testing

Automated tests catch many issues, but manual testing with assistive technologies is essential for full compliance verification.

**Keyboard Testing**: Navigate the entire platform using only the keyboard. Verify that all interactive elements are reachable, the focus order is logical, focus indicators are visible, and no keyboard traps exist. Test common workflows like form submission, modal interaction, and navigation.

**Screen Reader Testing**: Test with multiple screen readers across different platforms:
- **Windows**: NVDA (free) or JAWS (commercial)
- **macOS**: VoiceOver (built-in)
- **iOS**: VoiceOver (built-in)
- **Android**: TalkBack (built-in)

Verify that all content is announced correctly, interactive elements have appropriate labels, form errors are associated with inputs, and dynamic content changes are announced.

**Visual Testing**: Test with browser zoom at 200%, verify content reflows without horizontal scrolling, check color contrast in different lighting conditions, and test with high contrast mode enabled.

**Mobile Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices (not just emulators), verify touch targets are easy to activate, check that gestures have alternatives, and test with screen reader enabled.

### User Testing

The most valuable accessibility testing comes from users who rely on assistive technologies daily. Conduct usability testing with participants who have various disabilities. Gather feedback on navigation patterns, clarity of instructions, and overall user experience. Iterate based on real user feedback.

## Best Practices for Developers

### Semantic HTML

Always use semantic HTML elements that convey meaning and structure. Use `<button>` for buttons, not `<div>` with click handlers. Use `<nav>` for navigation, `<main>` for main content, `<article>` for self-contained content. Semantic elements provide built-in accessibility features and help screen readers understand page structure.

### ARIA Attributes

Use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility, but don't overuse them. The first rule of ARIA is "don't use ARIA" - use semantic HTML when possible. When custom components require ARIA, use it correctly:

- **Roles**: Define the purpose of an element (`role="dialog"`, `role="tab"`)
- **States**: Indicate current state (`aria-expanded="true"`, `aria-selected="false"`)
- **Properties**: Provide additional information (`aria-label="Close dialog"`, `aria-describedby="error-message"`)
- **Relationships**: Connect related elements (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-controls`)

### Keyboard Support

Ensure all functionality is available via keyboard. Interactive elements should be focusable (either natively or with `tabindex="0"`). Implement logical tab order (usually matches visual order). Handle keyboard events for custom components (Enter, Space, Escape, Arrows). Never create keyboard traps where users can't escape using the keyboard alone.

### Focus Management

Manage focus appropriately during dynamic interactions. When opening a modal, move focus to the modal (usually the close button or first interactive element). When closing a modal, return focus to the trigger element. When content loads or changes, consider whether focus should move to the new content. Use focus indicators that are always visible and have sufficient contrast.

### Forms and Validation

Every input must have an associated label. Use `<label>` elements with `for` attributes, or wrap inputs in labels. Mark required fields with `aria-required="true"` and visual indicators. Associate error messages with inputs using `aria-describedby`. Provide clear, specific error messages that explain how to fix the problem. Don't rely solely on color to indicate errors.

### Images and Media

Provide alternative text for all meaningful images using the `alt` attribute. Describe the content and function of the image, not just its appearance. Use empty alt (`alt=""`) for purely decorative images. For complex images (charts, diagrams), provide extended descriptions using `aria-describedby` or adjacent text. Provide captions and transcripts for video and audio content.

### Dynamic Content

Announce dynamic content changes to screen readers using ARIA live regions. Use `aria-live="polite"` for non-urgent updates (status messages, loading indicators). Use `aria-live="assertive"` for urgent updates (errors, warnings). Set `aria-atomic="true"` when the entire region should be announced, not just the changed portion.

### Testing During Development

Test accessibility as you build, not as an afterthought. Use keyboard navigation while developing. Run automated tests regularly. Use browser DevTools accessibility features to inspect ARIA attributes and accessibility tree. Consider accessibility in design reviews and code reviews.

## Common Patterns

### Accessible Modal Dialog

```typescript
import { useFocusTrap, useKeyboardNavigation } from '../hooks/useAccessibility';

function Modal({ isOpen, onClose, title, children }) {
  const modalRef = useFocusTrap(isOpen);
  
  useKeyboardNavigation(
    undefined,
    () => onClose(),  // Close on Escape
    undefined
  );
  
  if (!isOpen) return null;
  
  return (
    <div className="modal-overlay" onClick={onClose}>
      <div
        ref={modalRef}
        role="dialog"
        aria-modal="true"
        aria-labelledby="modal-title"
        className="modal-content"
        onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
      >
        <h2 id="modal-title">{title}</h2>
        <button
          onClick={onClose}
          aria-label="Close dialog"
          className="modal-close"
        >
          ×
        </button>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Accessible Form

```typescript
function AccessibleForm() {
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});
  const { announce } = useAriaLive();
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Validation logic...
    if (hasErrors) {
      announce('Form has errors. Please correct them and try again.', 'assertive');
    } else {
      announce('Form submitted successfully.', 'polite');
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div className="form-field">
        <label htmlFor="email">
          Email <span aria-label="required">*</span>
        </label>
        <input
          id="email"
          type="email"
          required
          aria-required="true"
          aria-invalid={!!errors.email}
          aria-describedby={errors.email ? 'email-error' : undefined}
        />
        {errors.email && (
          <div id="email-error" role="alert" className="error-message">
            {errors.email}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Accessible Tabs

```typescript
function AccessibleTabs() {
  const { activeTab, getTabProps, getTabPanelProps } = useTabs(3);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <div role="tablist" aria-label="Account settings">
        <button {...getTabProps(0)}>Profile</button>
        <button {...getTabProps(1)}>Security</button>
        <button {...getTabProps(2)}>Notifications</button>
      </div>
      
      <div {...getTabPanelProps(0)}>
        <h2>Profile Settings</h2>
        {/* Profile content */}
      </div>
      
      <div {...getTabPanelProps(1)}>
        <h2>Security Settings</h2>
        {/* Security content */}
      </div>
      
      <div {...getTabPanelProps(2)}>
        <h2>Notification Settings</h2>
        {/* Notification content */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
