# AETHERIAL Bug Bounty Program

## Overview

The **AETHERIAL Bug Bounty Program** is designed to encourage community participation in identifying and reporting bugs, security vulnerabilities, and other issues within the platform. Users who submit valid bug reports are rewarded with **Aether Coins**, the platform's virtual currency.

## Features

### 1. Bug Report Submission
- Users can submit bug reports through a dedicated web form at `/bug-bounty`
- Required fields:
  - **Title**: Brief description of the bug
  - **Description**: Detailed explanation including:
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Expected behavior
    - Actual behavior
    - Screenshots or videos (optional)

### 2. Reward Tiers

The program offers four reward tiers based on bug severity:

| Tier | Reward | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| ðŸ”´ **Critical** | 1000 Aether Coins | Security vulnerabilities, data loss, system crashes |
| ðŸŸ  **High** | 500 Aether Coins | Major functionality broken, performance issues |
| ðŸŸ¡ **Medium** | 250 Aether Coins | Feature not working as expected, UI issues |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Low** | 100 Aether Coins | Minor bugs, typos, cosmetic issues |

### 3. Admin Review Interface
- Administrators can view all submitted bug reports
- Status management:
  - **Open**: Newly submitted report
  - **Reviewing**: Under investigation
  - **Fixed**: Bug has been resolved
  - **Closed**: Report closed (duplicate, invalid, or completed)

### 4. Reward Distribution
- Rewards are automatically calculated based on severity tier
- Aether Coins are credited to user wallets upon bug verification
- Users can track their rewards in the wallet section

## Technical Implementation

  status: text("status").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at", { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),
});
```

4. **One Bug Per Report**: Submit separate reports for different issues
5. **Be Respectful**: Maintain a constructive and professional tone

## Admin Workflow
