## Features

### Meta Tag Management

The SEO Engine automatically generates and optimizes meta tags for every page, including title tags, meta descriptions, keywords, canonical URLs, and author information. The system ensures all meta tags meet search engine requirements and best practices.

**Title Optimization**: Titles are automatically formatted to include the site name, limited to 50-60 characters for optimal display in search results. The engine validates title length and provides warnings when titles are too short or too long.

**Meta Descriptions**: Descriptions are validated to ensure they fall within the 150-160 character sweet spot. The system can automatically generate descriptions from page content when none is provided, extracting the most relevant sentences and ensuring proper length.

**Keywords**: While less important for modern SEO, the engine supports keyword meta tags for platforms that still use them. Keywords are extracted from content using natural language processing and frequency analysis.

### Open Graph & Twitter Cards

Complete social media optimization with Open Graph tags for Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms, plus Twitter Card tags for enhanced tweet display. The system automatically generates appropriate tags based on content type (website, article, product, profile).

**Open Graph Tags**: Includes og:title, og:description, og:type, og:url, og:image, og:locale, article:published_time, article:modified_time, and article:author. Images are automatically resized and optimized for social media display.

**Twitter Cards**: Supports summary, summary_large_image, app, and player card types. The engine selects the appropriate card type based on content and available media.

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)

Generates schema.org structured data in JSON-LD format for rich snippets in search results. The engine supports multiple schema types and automatically selects the appropriate schema based on content type.

**Supported Schema Types**:
- **Article**: For blog posts, news articles, and written content
- **Product**: For e-commerce listings with pricing, availability, and ratings
- **Course**: For e-learning content with provider and pricing information
- **Organization**: For company/platform information
- **WebSite**: For homepage with search action
- **BreadcrumbList**: For navigation breadcrumbs
- **FAQPage**: For FAQ sections
- **JobPosting**: For job listings with salary and location

Each schema type includes all required and recommended properties according to Google's structured data guidelines.

### Sitemap Generation

Automatic XML sitemap generation with support for multiple sitemap types and sitemap indexes for large sites. Sitemaps are dynamically generated from database content and updated automatically when content changes.

**Standard Sitemap**: Includes all public pages with lastmod, changefreq, and priority values. The engine automatically calculates appropriate values based on content type and update frequency.

**Image Sitemap**: Includes image:image tags with captions, titles, and licenses for all images. Helps images appear in Google Image Search.

**Video Sitemap**: Includes video:video tags with thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and durations. Optimizes video content for search engines.

**News Sitemap**: Special sitemap for news articles following Google News guidelines. Includes publication information, publication dates, and keywords.

**Sitemap Index**: For sites with more than 50,000 URLs, the engine automatically splits sitemaps and generates a sitemap index file.

### SEO Analysis

Comprehensive content analysis that scores pages on multiple SEO factors and provides actionable recommendations for improvement.

**Analysis Metrics**:
- **Overall SEO Score**: 0-100 score based on all factors
- **Keyword Analysis**: Density, placement, and related keywords
- **Readability Score**: Flesch Reading Ease and complexity metrics
- **Technical Issues**: Missing tags, broken links, image alt text
- **Content Quality**: Word count, sentence length, passive voice

**Keyword Analysis**: Tracks primary keyword usage throughout the page, checking for presence in title, description, headings, first paragraph, and URL. Calculates keyword density and warns about keyword stuffing (>3% density) or under-optimization (<0.5% density).

**Readability Analysis**: Calculates Flesch Reading Ease score, average sentence length, average word length, passive voice percentage, and complex word percentage. Provides recommendations to improve readability for better user engagement.

**Issue Detection**: Identifies critical issues (missing title, missing description, missing H1), warnings (title too short/long, multiple H1 tags, images without alt text), and informational items (opportunities for improvement).

### Robots.txt Generation

Automatic robots.txt file generation with customizable disallow rules and sitemap references. The engine provides sensible defaults while allowing full customization.

**Default Rules**:
- Allow all user agents
- Disallow admin areas (/admin, /api, /private)
- Disallow query parameters for sorting and filtering
- Include sitemap URL

### URL Optimization

Automatic URL slug generation from titles, creating SEO-friendly URLs that are readable, keyword-rich, and properly formatted.

**Optimization Rules**:
- Convert to lowercase
- Remove special characters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove multiple consecutive hyphens
- Limit to 60 characters
- Remove leading/trailing hyphens

```tsx
import SEO from '../components/SEO';
import { generateArticleStructuredData } from '../utils/seo-helpers';

function ArticlePage() {
  const structuredData = generateArticleStructuredData({
    headline: "Article Title",
    description: "Article description...",
    image: "https://aetherial.com/images/article.jpg",
    datePublished: "2025-10-28T00:00:00Z",

  });

  return (
    <>
      <SEO
        title="Article Title"
        description="Article description..."
        keywords="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"

## Best Practices

### Title Tags

**Length**: Keep titles between 50-60 characters to prevent truncation in search results. The engine automatically validates and warns about titles outside this range.

**Format**: Use the pattern "Page Title | Site Name" for consistency. The SEO component handles this automatically.

**Keywords**: Include the primary keyword near the beginning of the title for maximum impact.

**Uniqueness**: Every page should have a unique title. Duplicate titles confuse search engines and users.

### Meta Descriptions

**Length**: Aim for 150-160 characters. Shorter descriptions waste valuable space, longer ones get truncated.

**Compelling**: Write descriptions that encourage clicks. Include a call-to-action when appropriate.

**Keywords**: Include the primary keyword naturally. Search engines bold matching keywords in search results.

**Accurate**: Descriptions should accurately reflect page content. Misleading descriptions harm user experience and SEO.

### Structured Data

**Accuracy**: All structured data must accurately represent page content. False or misleading data can result in search engine penalties.

**Completeness**: Include all required properties and as many recommended properties as possible. More complete data leads to richer search results.

**Validation**: Use Google's Rich Results Test to validate structured data before deployment.

### Sitemaps

**Updates**: Sitemaps should be updated whenever content changes. The AETHERIAL engine handles this automatically.

**Size**: Keep individual sitemaps under 50,000 URLs and 50MB. Use sitemap indexes for larger sites.

**Submission**: Submit sitemaps to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.

### Content Optimization

**Word Count**: Aim for at least 300 words per page. Longer, comprehensive content generally ranks better.

**Headings**: Use a single H1 tag per page with the primary keyword. Use H2-H6 tags to structure content logically.

**Images**: Include descriptive alt text for all images. Alt text helps with accessibility and image search.

**Internal Links**: Link to related content within your site. Internal linking helps search engines understand site structure.

**External Links**: Link to authoritative sources when appropriate. Quality outbound links can improve credibility.

## Performance

The SEO Engine is designed for high performance with minimal overhead:

**Caching**: Generated sitemaps and structured data are cached to reduce database queries.

**Lazy Generation**: Meta tags and structured data are generated on-demand, not stored in the database.

**Efficient Analysis**: Content analysis uses optimized algorithms to minimize processing time.

**Streaming**: Large sitemaps are streamed to reduce memory usage.
