# AETHERIAL Platform Data Analytics and Visualization

## 1. Objective

To create a comprehensive data analytics and visualization system that provides valuable insights into user behavior and platform usage. This will help to inform future development, business decisions, and content creation.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Data Warehouse

- **Concept:** We will use a data warehouse to store and manage our analytics data. The data warehouse will be optimized for analytical queries, allowing us to quickly and easily generate reports and dashboards.
- **Implementation:** We will use a cloud-based data warehouse, such as Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift.

### b. ETL Pipelines

- **Concept:** We will use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to move data from our production database to our data warehouse.
- **Implementation:** We will use a tool like Apache Airflow or Google Cloud Dataflow to create and manage our ETL pipelines.

### c. Data Visualization

- **Concept:** We will use a data visualization library to create interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- **Implementation:** We will use the `recharts` library, which is a popular and powerful data visualization library for React.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Data Warehouse Setup:** Set up a data warehouse and create the necessary tables.
2.  **ETL Pipeline Development:** Develop ETL pipelines to move data from our production database to our data warehouse.
3.  **Data Visualization Component:** Create a reusable data visualization component using `recharts`.
4.  **Analytics Dashboard:** Create an analytics dashboard to display key metrics and insights.
5.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for retrieving analytics data.
