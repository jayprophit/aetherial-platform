# Genspark AI Platform Analysis

## Overview

Genspark is an all-in-one AI workspace that evolved from an AI search engine into a comprehensive agentic platform. It uses a multi-agent framework where specialized AI agents work together to perform complex tasks beyond simple information retrieval.

## Strategic Pivot: From Search to Agentic Platform

### Original Vision (June 2024)

Genspark launched as a Perplexity-Wikipedia hybrid that created custom "Sparkpages" for research topics.

**Initial Features:**
- AI-powered research
- Custom Sparkpage generation
- Wikipedia-style exploration
- AI chatbot for content discussion

### The Pivot (May 2025)

After raising $100M in Series A funding (April 2025), Genspark made a radical decision to kill its search product despite having 5 million users.

**Rationale:**
Traditional AI search was too constrained by predefined workflows. Genspark wanted to build an agentic solution capable of "truly adaptive, context-rich problem-solving" that could independently reason through problems and take action on behalf of users.

**Result:**
The Genspark Super Agent - an executive-level AI with an army of specialized sub-agents.

## Architecture: Three-Tier Agent System

Genspark operates on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with three distinct tiers.

### Tier 1: Super Agent

The Super Agent sits at the top of the pyramid and autonomously orchestrates Tier 2 and Tier 3 agents.

**Capabilities:**
- Proactively analyzes problems
- Breaks down tasks into sub-tasks
- Selects relevant specialist agents
- Executes sub-tasks with monitoring
- Integrates results into coherent outputs
- Adapts based on intermediate results

**Workflow:**
1. Receive user request
2. Think through the problem
3. Decompose into sub-tasks
4. Select appropriate agents for each sub-task
5. Execute sub-tasks in parallel or sequence
6. Monitor results and adjust as needed
7. Synthesize final output

**Example Outputs:**
- Complete landing pages
- Interactive web applications
- Comprehensive research reports
- Slide presentations
- Spreadsheets with analysis
- AI-generated images and videos

## Genspark vs Perplexity

### Fundamental Philosophy

**Perplexity:**
AI-powered search engine that parses requests, searches the web, and returns cited answers. Functions as a research assistant providing information.

**Genspark:**
Designed to perform tasks. While it can find information, its strength lies in taking that information and doing something with it: creating websites, coding apps, making phone calls, etc.

### Output Formats

**Perplexity:**
Primarily text-based summaries and reports, occasionally with tables and charts.

**Genspark:**
Wide range of formats including coded pages, apps, slide decks, spreadsheets, AI images, and videos.

### Use Case Fit

**Perplexity:**
Best for search-focused tasks and well-researched reports.

**Genspark:**
Better for tasks requiring rich media, interactive elements, or actions beyond research.

### Pricing Model

**Perplexity:**
- Free tier: Unlimited basic searches + 3 daily Pro searches
- Pro ($20/month): Unlimited Pro searches + Deep Research

**Genspark:**
- Credit-based system
- Credit consumption varies by task complexity
- Video generation and advanced agents use more credits
- Best used sparingly for high-complexity tasks

## Technical Capabilities
