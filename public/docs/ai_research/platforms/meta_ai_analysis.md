# Meta AI Platform Analysis

## Overview

Meta AI is Meta's artificial intelligence assistant integrated across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It's powered by the Llama family of open-source large language models and offers conversational AI capabilities with context memory and personalization.

## Core Technology: Llama Models

### Llama 4 (Latest - April 2025)

Meta's most advanced open-source language model with native multimodality.

**Key Features:**
- **Native Multimodality**: Early fusion approach integrating text and vision tokens into unified model backbone
- **Image Grounding**: Best-in-class ability to align user prompts with relevant visual concepts and anchor responses to image regions
- **Open Source**: Freely available for commercial use
- **High Performance**: Competitive with proprietary models

**Architecture Innovation:**
Early fusion seamlessly integrates different modalities (text, vision) rather than processing them separately and combining later.

### Llama Family Evolution
