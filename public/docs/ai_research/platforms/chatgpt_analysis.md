## Core Technologies

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The NLP pipeline consists of six stages that process text before interpretation and response generation.

**Stage 1: Tokenization**
Breaking complex data into discrete tokens that can be processed individually. Each word or subword becomes a token that the model can understand.

**Stage 2: Stemming**
Reducing inflected words to their root form. For example, "running," "runs," and "ran" all reduce to the stem "run."

**Stage 3: Lemmatisation**
Similar to stemming but returns meaningful words in proper form. More sophisticated than stemming as it considers the context.

**Stage 4: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
Sorting based on frequency of occurrence and generating document vectors by multiplying TF and IDF values to determine word importance.

**Stage 5: Sparse Matrices**
Creating document vectors that represent text in a mathematical format suitable for machine learning.

**Stage 6: One Hot Encoding**
Converting categorical factors into numerical structures that machine learning algorithms can process.

### Generative AI Foundation

ChatGPT employs generative AI techniques based on several architectures working together.

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
Two neural networks work in tandem: a generator creates synthetic data while a discriminator evaluates authenticity. This adversarial process improves generation quality.

**Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
Learn the underlying probability distribution of data, enabling generation of samples from the learned distribution with controlled variation.

**Transformers (GPT Architecture)**
The primary architecture for generating human-like text, stories, and code. Uses attention mechanisms to understand context and relationships.

### Large Language Model (LLM) Architecture

ChatGPT is built on a Large Language Model that uses deep learning transformers trained on massive text datasets.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Billions to trillions of parameters
- Internal variables adjusted during training
- Pattern recognition from vast data
- Context-aware generation

### Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by using attention mechanisms instead of recurrent or convolutional layers.

**Attention Mechanisms**
Model relationships between elements in a sequence (words in sentences) without sequential processing. This enables parallel processing and better long-range dependencies.

**Applications:**
- Translation
- Text summarization
- Question answering
- Image processing (Vision Transformers)
- Speech recognition
- Audio generation

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Specifics:**
- Produces text outputs based on input
- Pre-trained on large corpus of text data
- Learns language patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning
- Uses transformer architecture for context understanding
- Creates relationships between words and concepts

## Functional Requirements

The ChatGPT system must support several core functionalities to provide a complete user experience.

**User Interaction**
Support for users to chat with the model through a conversational interface with natural language input and output.

**Conversation Management**
Maintain conversation context and chat history across sessions, enabling continuity and reference to previous interactions.

**Account & Payment**
User account management with subscription tiers and payment processing for premium features.

**Rate Limiting**
Implement rate limits on free accounts and resource-intensive models (like GPT-4) to manage costs and ensure fair usage.

**Content Safety**
Ensure replies are appropriate, non-aggressive, and maintain good context. Filter harmful content and prevent misuse.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability
Handle 100M active users with rapid growth. Architecture must scale horizontally to accommodate increasing demand.

### High Availability
Maximize uptime to 99.95% through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and distributed deployment.

### Consistency
Eventual consistency model allows for distributed systems to synchronize over time while maintaining performance.

### Low Latency
Respond within seconds to maintain conversational flow. Target response time under 2 seconds for most queries.

### High Throughput
Process millions of user queries per second across the global infrastructure.
