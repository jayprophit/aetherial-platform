# Perplexity AI Platform Analysis

## Overview

Perplexity is an AI-powered search (answer) engine that answers questions based exclusively on factual, real-time data retrieved from trusted sources, with every answer including clickable citations to original sources.

## Core Philosophy

### Ground Truth Only

Perplexity follows a strict principle: **"You are not supposed to say anything that you didn't retrieve."**

**Key Distinction from Traditional LLMs:**
- If insufficient information exists, Perplexity says so rather than generating potentially false information
- Uses LLMs to craft answers, not to generate information
- Sticks to retrieved ground truth exclusively
- Avoids hallucinations through strict retrieval constraints

### Factual Real-Time Data

Unlike traditional search engines or chatbots, Perplexity provides concise answers based on current, verified information.

**Differences from Competitors:**
- **vs Google**: Doesn't give a list of links; provides direct answers with citations
- **vs ChatGPT**: Doesn't generate potentially unreliable answers; only uses retrieved facts
- **vs Traditional RAG**: Goes beyond RAG by enforcing ground truth constraints

## Architecture Components

### Two-Component System

**Search Component**
Focuses on retrieval of relevant, factual information from trusted sources.

**LLM Component**  
Focuses on writing clear, concise answers based on retrieved information.

This separation ensures factual accuracy while maintaining readability.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Plus

Perplexity uses RAG fundamentals but extends them significantly.

**Traditional RAG Process:**
1. Retrieve relevant documents for query
2. Extract relevant paragraphs
3. Add to LLM context
4. Generate answer

**Perplexity's Enhanced RAG:**
1. Retrieve relevant documents
2. Extract relevant paragraphs  
3. Verify factual grounding
4. Craft answer strictly from retrieved content
5. Include citations for every claim
6. Refuse to answer if insufficient information

### Custom Model: Sonar Large 32K

Perplexity has trained their own model based on LLaMA 70B, fine-tuned for specific skills.

**Specialized Training:**
- Referencing citations accurately
- Summarization from multiple sources
- Fact extraction and verification
- Grounded answer generation

**Model Agnostic Approach:**
Also works with frontier models:
- GPT-4o (OpenAI)
- Claude Sonnet (Anthropic)
- Claude Opus (Anthropic) - Pro subscription required

This flexibility allows choosing the best model for each task.

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Query Understanding**
Language models analyze the context and intent of the user's question to understand what information is needed.

**Step 2: Web Search**
Search component retrieves accurate, up-to-date information from trusted sources across the web.

**Step 3: Relevance Filtering**
Extracted results are filtered for relevance and factual accuracy.

**Step 4: Answer Crafting**
LLM component crafts a comprehensive, concise answer based exclusively on retrieved information.

**Step 5: Citation Integration**
Every claim in the answer is linked to its source with clickable citations.

**Step 6: Fact Verification**
Final answer is verified to ensure all statements are grounded in retrieved sources.

## Hybrid Distributed Retrieval Engine

Perplexity's retrieval system is a sophisticated hybrid engine combining multiple retrieval strategies.

**Goals:**
- Maximize recall (find all relevant information)
- Maximize precision (only relevant information)
- Balance speed and accuracy

**Multi-Strategy Approach:**
- Keyword-based search
- Semantic search
- Neural retrieval
- Hybrid ranking

## Multi-Stage Retrieval and Ranking Pipeline

### Progressive Refinement

The pipeline progressively refines results through multiple stages.

**Stage 1: Broad Retrieval**
Cast wide net to capture all potentially relevant sources.

**Stage 2: Initial Ranking**
Rank retrieved documents by relevance using multiple signals.

**Stage 3: Re-ranking**
Apply more sophisticated models to re-rank top candidates.

**Stage 4: Final Selection**
Choose best sources for answer generation.

**Stage 5: Citation Extraction**
Identify specific passages to cite for each claim.

### Ranking Signals

Multiple signals contribute to ranking quality.

**Relevance Signals:**
- Semantic similarity to query
- Keyword match quality
- Document authority
- Recency of information
- Source trustworthiness

**Quality Signals:**
- Content depth
- Factual accuracy
