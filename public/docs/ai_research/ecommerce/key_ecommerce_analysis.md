# Key E-Commerce Platforms Analysis

## Amazon

### Overview
Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce platform, founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. Starting as an online bookstore, it evolved into "The Everything Store" with over 300 million active customers and $500B+ in annual revenue.

### Core Architecture

**Microservices Architecture**
Amazon pioneered microservices architecture, decomposing their monolithic application into hundreds of independent services. Each service owns its data, scales independently, and communicates via APIs.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
- Decoupled services with clear APIs
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Fault isolation (one service failure doesn't crash entire system)
- Polyglot persistence (each service chooses its database)

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS cloud (Amazon's own infrastructure)
- Horizontal scaling across thousands of servers
- Multi-region deployment for global reach
- Content Delivery Network (CloudFront) for fast page loads
- Elastic Load Balancing for traffic distribution

**Database Strategy:**
- DynamoDB (NoSQL) for high-scale key-value data
- RDS (relational) for transactional data
- S3 for object storage (images, videos)
- ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) for caching
- Redshift for data warehousing and analytics

### Recommendation Engine

Amazon's recommendation system is legendary, responsible for 35% of total sales. It uses collaborative filtering, machine learning, and deep learning to personalize product suggestions.

**Recommendation Algorithms:**

**Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering**
Amazon's patented algorithm that scales better than user-to-user filtering. Instead of finding similar users, it finds similar items based on purchase patterns.

**How It Works:**
1. Build item-to-item similarity matrix
2. When user views/buys item A, recommend items similar to A
3. Combine recommendations from all items in user's history
4. Rank by relevance score

**Machine Learning Models:**
- Neural networks for deep personalization
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
- Transformer models for understanding context
- Reinforcement learning for long-term optimization

**Data Inputs:**
- Purchase history
- Browsing history
- Search queries
- Ratings and reviews
- Wishlist items
- Cart additions
- Time spent on pages
- Device and location data

**Recommendation Types:**
- "Customers who bought this also bought..."
- "Frequently bought together"
- "Inspired by your browsing history"
- "Recommended for you"
- "Best sellers in your category"
- "New releases you might like"

**Generative AI Integration (2024)**
Amazon now uses large language models to generate personalized product descriptions and recommendations, making them more relevant to individual shoppers.
