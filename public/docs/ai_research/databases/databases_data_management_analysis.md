## Category 1: Relational Databases (SQL)

### PostgreSQL - Advanced Open-Source Database

**Overview:**
PostgreSQL is the world's most advanced open-source relational database, known for its robustness, extensibility, and standards compliance. It powers everything from small applications to large enterprises and is the foundation of many cloud database services.

**Core Architecture:**
PostgreSQL uses a process-based architecture with a shared memory area for inter-process communication. Each client connection spawns a new backend process, providing isolation and stability.

**Key Features:**

**ACID Compliance:**
PostgreSQL provides full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees, ensuring data integrity even in the face of system failures, power outages, or concurrent access.

**Advanced Data Types:**
Beyond standard SQL types, PostgreSQL supports JSON/JSONB (binary JSON), arrays, hstore (key-value), UUID, geometric types, network addresses (INET, CIDR), full-text search types, and custom types.

**Extensibility:**
PostgreSQL's extension system allows adding new functionality without modifying the core. Popular extensions include PostGIS (geospatial), pg_trgm (fuzzy text search), pgcrypto (encryption), and timescaledb (time-series).

**Indexing:**
Multiple index types support different query patterns: B-tree (default, general purpose), Hash (equality comparisons), GiST (geometric and full-text), SP-GiST (partitioned data), GIN (inverted indexes for arrays and JSON), and BRIN (block range indexes for large tables).

**Full-Text Search:**
Built-in full-text search capabilities with support for multiple languages, stemming, ranking, and phrase searching, eliminating the need for external search engines in many cases.

**JSON Support:**
Native JSON and JSONB support allows storing and querying semi-structured data with indexing, making PostgreSQL suitable for both relational and document-oriented workloads.

**Replication & High Availability:**
Streaming replication provides real-time data synchronization to standby servers. Logical replication allows selective replication of specific tables or databases. Tools like Patroni and repmgr provide automated failover.

**Partitioning:**
Declarative partitioning (range, list, hash) improves query performance and manageability for large tables by dividing them into smaller, more manageable pieces.
