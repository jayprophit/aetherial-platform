## The Constitution: Immutable Core Principles

### Article I: Core Mission (Unchangeable)

The following mission and principles are **permanent and cannot be altered** by any vote or governance mechanism:

**1. Unified Platform:**
Aetherial shall remain ONE single unified platform combining all human needs and services. The platform shall never be fragmented, split, or divided into separate entities.

**2. User Data Ownership:**
Users shall own 100% of their data. Data shall be stored on decentralized systems with user-controlled encryption. No entity shall have access to user data without explicit user consent.

**3. Decentralized Governance:**
The platform shall be governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with transparent, blockchain-based decision-making. No single entity, corporation, or government shall control the platform.

**4. Global Unity:**
The platform's purpose is to unite all of humanity under shared goals of peace, prosperity, education, health, and sustainability. This mission shall never be compromised.

**5. Freedom & Equality:**
All users shall have equal rights regardless of race, gender, nationality, religion, or any other characteristic. Freedom of speech shall be protected within the bounds of law and community safety.

**6. Transparency:**
All governance decisions, financial transactions, and platform operations shall be transparent and auditable on the blockchain.

User security and privacy shall be paramount. The platform shall employ state-of-the-art encryption, security measures, and privacy-preserving technologies.

**8. Human-AI Collaboration:**
The platform shall facilitate symbiotic collaboration between humans and AI, with humans maintaining ultimate decision-making authority on ethical and governance matters.

**9. Non-Profit Core:**
While the platform may generate revenue, its core mission is to serve humanity, not maximize profits. Excess revenue shall be distributed to users via Universal Basic Income and community initiatives.
