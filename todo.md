## Current Status
**Phase 1 & 2:** Genesis DNA + 3D Blockchain (Starting Now)
**Progress:** 5% complete (documentation site done, platform build starting)

---

## Notes
- All features must work with AI disabled (dual interface: manual + AI)
- Genesis DNA file controls all platform configuration
- 3D blockchain stores all platform data
- Platform must be deployable as self-contained VM
- Open source ready with industry standards
- One codebase, infinite customizations
