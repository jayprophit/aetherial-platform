# AETHERIAL Platform Biometric Authentication

## 1. Objective

To provide a secure and convenient way for users to log in to the AETHERIAL platform using biometric data, such as their fingerprint or face. This will enhance the security of the platform and improve the user experience by eliminating the need for passwords.

## 2. Core Components

### a. WebAuthn API

- **Concept:** We will use the WebAuthn API, which is a web standard for secure public-key authentication. WebAuthn allows users to log in with authenticators, such as fingerprint readers, security keys, or facial recognition.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like `@simplewebauthn/server` and `@simplewebauthn/browser` to simplify the implementation of the WebAuthn API.

### b. Credential Management

- **Concept:** The server will be responsible for managing the public key credentials for each user.
- **Implementation:** We will store the public key credentials in the database, associated with the user's account.

### c. User Experience

- **Concept:** The user experience for registering and authenticating with biometrics should be as seamless as possible.
- **Implementation:** We will provide a clear and intuitive user interface for managing biometric authenticators.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **WebAuthn Library Integration:** Integrate a WebAuthn library into our client-side and server-side applications.
2.  **Database Schema:** Update the database schema to include a table for storing public key credentials.
3.  **Registration Flow:** Implement the registration flow for new biometric authenticators.
4.  **Authentication Flow:** Implement the authentication flow for logging in with biometrics.
5.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for managing biometric authenticators.
