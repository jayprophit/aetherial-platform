# AETHERIAL Platform CDN Strategy

## 1. Objective

To enhance the performance, scalability, and security of the AETHERIAL Platform by implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN). The CDN will cache and serve static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) from a global network of edge servers, reducing latency for users worldwide.

## 2. CDN Provider Selection

**Provider:** Cloudflare

**Reasoning:**
- **Generous Free Tier:** Cloudflare offers a robust free tier that includes CDN, DDoS protection, and a global network, making it ideal for this project.
- **Ease of Integration:** Cloudflare is well-documented and straightforward to set up, requiring only a DNS change to route traffic through its network.
- **Performance & Security:** Provides significant performance gains through caching and minification, and enhances security with its Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS mitigation.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simulation in Development (Current Phase)

Due to the limitations of the sandbox environment, a full Cloudflare integration is not feasible. Instead, we will simulate the integration to prepare the application for a production environment.

1.  **Environment Variable:**
    - A `VITE_CDN_URL` will be added to the `.env` file.
    - This variable will hold the base URL for our static assets.

2.  **Code Modification:**
    - The application code will be updated to prepend the `VITE_CDN_URL` to all static asset paths.
    - This will be handled in the Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) to ensure all assets are correctly referenced.

3.  **Vite Configuration:**
    - The `vite.config.ts` file will be modified to use the `VITE_CDN_URL` as the `base` for production builds. This automatically rewrites asset URLs.

### Phase 2: Production Deployment

Once the application is ready for a production environment, the following steps will be taken:

1.  **Cloudflare Account Setup:**
    - A Cloudflare account will be created.
    - The application's domain will be added to Cloudflare.

2.  **DNS Configuration:**
    - The domain's nameservers will be updated to point to Cloudflare's nameservers.

3.  **Asset Caching:**
    - Caching rules will be configured in the Cloudflare dashboard to ensure static assets are cached with a long TTL (Time To Live).

4.  **Environment Variable Update:**
    - The `VITE_CDN_URL` in the production environment will be updated to the actual application domain (e.g., `https://aetherial.io`).

## 4. Benefits

- **Reduced Latency:** Users will download assets from the nearest Cloudflare edge server, resulting in faster load times.
- **Improved Scalability:** The CDN will handle the majority of asset requests, reducing the load on the origin server.
- **Enhanced Security:** Cloudflare's network provides a first line of defense against DDoS attacks and other malicious traffic.
- **Lower Bandwidth Costs:** By caching assets at the edge, the CDN reduces the amount of data that needs to be served from the origin server.
