# AETHERIAL Platform AI NPC Strategy

## 1. Objective

To create intelligent and engaging Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that can interact with players in a natural and dynamic way. These NPCs will be powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable realistic conversations, complex behaviors, and the ability to participate in the platform's economy and quest systems.

## 2. Core Components

### a. NPC Architecture

- **Concept:** Each NPC will have a distinct personality, backstory, and set of goals.
- **Implementation:** NPC data will be stored in the database, including their name, description, personality traits, and current state.

### b. Dialogue System

- **Concept:** NPCs will be able to engage in natural, unscripted conversations with players.
- **Implementation:** We will use a powerful LLM, such as GPT-4 or a fine-tuned open-source model, to generate dialogue in real-time. The dialogue will be informed by the NPC's personality, the player's history, and the current game state.

### c. Behavior Tree

- **Concept:** A behavior tree will be used to define the NPC's actions and decision-making process.
- **Implementation:** The behavior tree will allow for complex behaviors, such as pathfinding, interacting with objects, and responding to player actions.

## 3. Database Schema

```sql
-- NPCs
CREATE TABLE npcs (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  personality JSON, -- e.g., { "trait": "value", ... }
  backstory TEXT,
  current_location VARCHAR(255),
  current_activity VARCHAR(255)
);
```

## 4. Implementation Plan

1.  **Database Schema:** Update the database schema to include the `npcs` table.
2.  **NPC Service:** Create a service to manage NPC creation, state updates, and interactions.
3.  **LLM Integration:** Integrate with an LLM to power the dialogue system.
4.  **Behavior Tree Implementation:** Implement a behavior tree to control NPC actions.
5.  **Game Engine Integration:** Integrate the NPC service with the game engine to allow NPCs to interact with the game world and players.
