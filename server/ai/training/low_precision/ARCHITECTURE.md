# Low-Precision Training Architecture

## Overview
This module implements low-precision training techniques for large language models, supporting FP32 down to binary (1-bit) precision. The architecture is designed to be hardware-agnostic while providing accurate emulation of various precision levels.

## Core Components

### 1. Precision Formats
- **FP32/BF16**: Baseline floating-point formats
- **FP8 (E4M3/E5M2)**: 8-bit floating point
- **FP4 (E2M1)**: 4-bit floating point
- **FP2 (E1M0)**: 2-bit floating point
- **Binary/1-bit**: Extreme quantization

### 2. Key Techniques
- **Mixed-Precision Training**: Different precisions for weights, activations, and gradients
- **Straight-Through Estimator (STE)**: For non-differentiable quantization
- **Sparse Training**: Dynamic sparsity and pruning
- **Gradient Scaling**: For stable low-precision training
- **Unit-Scale Parametrization (uP)**: For stable weight updates

### 3. Virtual Hardware Emulation
- Precision-aware computation simulation
- Energy and memory usage estimation
- Performance profiling for different hardware targets
