# AETHERIAL Platform Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Integration

## 1. Objective

To create a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) integration system that enables users to interact with the AETHERIAL metaverse using their thoughts. This will create a truly immersive and futuristic experience, and it will also open up new possibilities for accessibility and user interaction.

## 2. Core Components

### a. BCI Device

- **Concept:** We will use a BCI device to capture the user's brainwaves. The BCI device will be a non-invasive device that is worn on the head.
- **Implementation:** We will use a commercially available BCI device, such as the Emotiv Insight or the Muse S.

### b. Data Processing Library

- **Concept:** We will use a data processing library to process the raw BCI data and extract meaningful signals.
- **Implementation:** We will use a library like `bci.js` or `OpenBCI` to process the BCI data.

### c. WebSockets

- **Concept:** We will use WebSockets to stream the processed BCI data to our client-side application and our server-side applications.
- **Implementation:** We will use our existing WebSocket implementation, which is based on the `ws` library.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **BCI Device Integration:** Integrate a BCI device with our client-side application.
2.  **Data Processing:** Implement a data processing solution to process the raw BCI data and extract meaningful signals.
3.  **WebSocket Streaming:** Implement a solution to stream the processed BCI data to our client-side application and our server-side applications.
4.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for configuring and managing BCI devices.
5.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for visualizing and interacting with BCI data.
