# Aetherial Platform Architecture

## System Overview

The Aetherial Platform is a cross-platform application that provides a unified experience across web, mobile, and desktop. The system is built with a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

- Cross-platform (iOS and Android)
- Offline-first approach
- Native performance with JavaScript

#### Desktop Applications
- Built with Electron
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Native system integration
- Auto-update functionality

### 2. Backend Services

#### API Gateway

- CDN integration
- Image and video processing

### 4. Infrastructure

#### Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Auto-scaling
- Self-healing

#### Monitoring and Logging
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK Stack for logging

#### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automated testing
- Blue/Green deployments

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**
   - Client sends credentials to Authentication Service
   - JWT token is issued upon successful authentication
   - Token is stored securely and sent with subsequent requests

2. **Content Creation**
   - User creates content in the client application
   - Content is validated and sent to the API Gateway
   - API Gateway routes the request to the Content Service
   - Content is processed, stored, and indexed

3. **Content Consumption**
   - Client requests content from the API Gateway
   - API Gateway checks authentication and permissions
   - Content Service retrieves and returns the content
   - Client renders the content to the user

## Security Considerations

- All communication is encrypted with TLS 1.3
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Performance Considerations

- Caching at multiple levels (CDN, API, database)
- Lazy loading of non-critical resources
- Database query optimization
- Horizontal scaling of stateless services

## Deployment Architecture

### Development
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Hot-reloading for fast iteration
- Mock services for external dependencies

### Staging
- Mirrors production environment
- Automated testing
- Performance testing

### Production
- Multi-region deployment
- Auto-scaling
- Disaster recovery
- Zero-downtime deployments

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- Next.js 13
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Redux Toolkit
- React Query

### Mobile
- React Native
- React Navigation
- Reanimated
- MMKV Storage

### Backend
- Node.js 18+
- NestJS
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- BullMQ

### Infrastructure

- AWS/GCP/Azure
- Terraform
- GitHub Actions

## Future Considerations

- Edge computing for lower latency
- WebAssembly for performance-critical components
- Decentralized identity with blockchain
- AI/ML model serving at the edge
