# AETHERIAL Platform Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science

## 1. Objective

To create a crowdsourcing and citizen science system that enables users to participate in large-scale data collection and analysis projects, contributing to scientific research and other collaborative endeavors. This will be a powerful tool for community engagement and a key feature of the AETHERIAL metaverse.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Project Management System

- **Concept:** We will use a project management system to create and manage our crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. The project management system will provide a set of tools and services for creating, configuring, and managing projects.
- **Implementation:** We will create a new database table to store our projects, and we will create a new service to manage our projects.

### b. Data Collection and Analysis Toolkit

- **Concept:** We will use a data collection and analysis toolkit to collect and analyze data from our users. The data collection and analysis toolkit will provide a set of tools and services for creating and managing data collection forms, and for analyzing and visualizing data.
- **Implementation:** We will create a new service to manage our data collection and analysis toolkit.

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Project Management System:** Create a new database table to store our projects, and create a new service to manage our projects.
2.  **Data Collection and Analysis Toolkit:** Create a new service to manage our data collection and analysis toolkit.
3.  **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints for creating and managing projects, and for collecting and analyzing data.
4.  **UI/UX:** Create a user interface for interacting with the crowdsourcing and citizen science system.
